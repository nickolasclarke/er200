# ER 200 Problemset 3, Nick Clarke

## 1 Cogeneration
*On the first field trip, some of your classmates visited UC Berkeley’s 24 MW cogeneration plant that supplies electricity and steam to campus facilities. Cogeneration, also known as combined heat and power, is considered an energy efficient technology. Visit these websites to learn more about cogeneration: The Environmental Protection Agency’s CHP Partnership: http://www.epa.gov/chp/ and the Pacific Region CHP Application Center:  http://pacificchptap.org. [7 points]*
### 1a
*Thermodynamically, why is cogeneration more efficient than conventional generation methods?[3 points]*

**ANSWERS:** Cogeneration takes advantage of the low-grade waste heat that under conventional generation methods is not able to be converted into W_out. Cogeneration adds an additional step to harvest this waste heat as part of W_in in the second stage, and uses this heat as part of additional W_out. Thus, less energy leaves the system as Q_out.

### 1b
*Cogeneration is often discussed in the context of climate change mitigation and greenhouse gas reduction technology.  Write one brief paragraph on why this is the case. [4 points]*

**ANSWERS:**  As is seen in the calculations of 2c below, the total heat energy that is turned into useful work, also known as thermal efficiency, is quite low. In this case, over half of the heat energy is lost. Cogeneration helps alleviate this by harvesting a portion of this waste heat energy that is unusable by the first stage, and gathers some additional useful work out of it. This allows us to get more work out of a fuel that is already going to be burned regardless. Furthermore, given that the second stage work is normally used in the same locality to the cogeneration plant, it may be even more efficient than the energy that would otherwise need to be used to perform the task. For example, if the cogeneration plant delivers steam condensate as its work in the second stage for use in heating a building, the thermal efficiency of creating the steam could be higher than the imported electricity the building may use to run HVAC units to heat the building. 

## 2 Thermodynamics of Energy Systems
*Combined Cycle Plants 2. Dynegy’s Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey, a natural gas fired plant, used to be the largest generation facility in the state of California with a total installed capacity of approximately 2,540 MW. Of the four generators in the facility, the two newer generators are still in operation, but the two older generators were retired in December 2016. The two newer generators (1,020 MW total) are combined cycle (using both the Brayton cycle for gas and Rankine cycle for steam), and the older two generators (760 MW each) used gas turbines only (the Brayton cycle). Combined cycles are another way to improve the overall efficiency of a power plant. The rate of energy added during the combustion of fuel when the generator is running at full capacity (not taking into account cycle efficiency) is 5,350 million Btu/hr per older generator. Combined cycle natural gas power plants in California have an average annual capacity factor of about 42.7%1. [29 points]*

###2a -
*Draw 2 schematics showing the difference between the Brayton Cycle and Combined Cycle and label all components.  In thermodynamic terms, briefly explain the function of each component, including what takes place in each component in terms of heat exchange, work, temperature and pressure*

###2b
*Calculate the Carnot efficiency of a Brayton cycle system operating at the following temperatures. In one sentence, explain what Carnot efficiency represents. (Note: all temperatures given in degrees Celsius) [5 points]:*
- *T1 = temps at exit of the exhaust heat exchanger and inlet of the compressor = 30ºC*   
- *T2 = temp at exit of the compressor and inlet of the combustor = 390ºC*  
- *T3 = temp at the exit of the combustor and the inlet of the turbine = 1085.ºC*
- *T4 = temp at the exit of the turbine and the inlet of the exhaust heat exchanger = 535ºC*

```python
t_high = 1085
t_low = 30

def carnot(t_high, t_low):
    # convert to Kelvin
    high = t_high + 273
    low = t_low + 273
    return (high - low) / high

nc = carnot(t_high,t_low)
```
**ANSWERS:** Carnot Efficency = 0.78. Carnot efficency represents the maxiumum amount of energy that can be extracted from a heat engine in an ideal setting. 

###2c
*Calculate the 1st law efficiency of the generator that uses the Brayton cycle. In one sentence, explain what first law efficiency represents. [4 points]*

```python
w_net_mw = 760
q_in_btu_hr = 5350e6

mw_to_btu = 1 / 3.41e6

def first_eff(w_net, q_in):
    return w_net / q_in

q_in_mw = q_in_btu_hr * mw_to_btu

n1 = first_eff(w_net_mw,q_in_mw)
```
**ANSWERS:** N1 efficency = 0.48. This is the "thermal" efficency, and is how efficiently a heat engine converts heat input into work output. I like to think of it as "realized" efficiency

###2d
*What is the second law efficiency of the generator that uses the Brayton cycle? In one sentence, explain what second law efficiency represents. [4 points]*

```python
def second_eff(n1, nc):
return n1/nc

second_eff(n1,nc)
```
**ANSWERS:** N2 efficency = 0.62. This is how close to the theoretical maximum, the carnot efficiency, you have achieved.  

###2e
*Consider the newer combined cycle generators. Assume that the performance of the gas turbines in these generators is the same as the older generators which use only the Brayton cycle. If the thermal efficiency for the steam turbine system (the Rankine cycle) is 33%, calculate the overall efficiency for the combined cycle. [4 points]*

```python
e1 = first_eff(w_net_mw,q_in_mw) # 0.48
e2 = 0.33

def overall_eff(e1, e2):
    return e1 + (1 - e1) * e2

print(overall_eff(e1,e2))
```
**ANSWERS:** Overall efficiency = 0.65.

###2f
*As of 2018, what is the total energy output from the Moss Landing Power Plant in a typical year (in kWh)? [2 points]*

```python
mw_2018 = 1020
cap_factor = 0.427

kwh_2018 = (1020 * 8760) * 1000 * cap_factor
print(kwh_2018)
```
**ANSWERS:** 3.8E9 Kwh in 2018

## The Environmental Impacts of the “Oil Transition”
*[For ER200/PP284 Students Only] We will now look quantitatively at the CO2 implications of a transition to oil substitutes.  We will use stylized equations to estimate roughly the impacts of this transition. (Hint:  one easy way is to build simple models that are easily reconfigurable for different input values, e.g. in Excel.) [30 points]*

**ANSWERS:** See spreadsheet, sheet "Problem 4" for anwswer to 4A - 4D. See Methods below: 

###4A
- Used 3,000 BBL (farrell, 2006) as Q for curve A. 
- Curve A
  - Solved q = sigma Pm sqrt(2 pi) for PM (max production rate 
  - Graphed Production (P) vs time (t) using t_2006 as t_m and years 2000-2025 for t
- Curve B
  - Increased curve A Pm by 10% for Curve B, since the question noted there is "less oil in curve a". We assumed this was total oil. 
- Graphed P vs t using t_2017 as tm and 2000-2025 for t

###4B 
- Increased each P value by 2% per year starting after the peak year, y = Pm_tm(102)^t. 
- plot these new y-values against  from 2000-20025

###4C 
- (gap amount 2025) / (MJ/gbbl)(g-c/MJ) = g-c
 - calculate for 50% tar sands, 25% synthfuels 25% oil shale, then add up

###4D
- same process as C. Carbon inplicatoinare are 1/2 of that previous question, implying that vehicle efficiency alone can make a significant cut to emissions

###4E

$$Q_{synth fuels} = ({X_{conventional}} * {Q_{conventional}}) - ({X_{hybrid}} * {Q_{hybrid}})$$
$$Q_{cars} = ({X_{conventional}} + {X_{hybrid}})$$

Solve for the System of Equations:

$$(3.1E9 * \frac{42_{gal}}{1_{barrel oil}}) = ({X_{conventional} * \frac{10,000_{miles}}{30_{mpg}}}) - ({X_{hybrid}}*  \frac{10,000_{miles}}{80_{mpg}})$$

$$130.2E9 = [(800E6 - X_h) * 333] - [X_h * 125]$$
$$130.2E9 = (2.6E11 - 333 * X_h) - (125 * X_h)$$
$$X_h = \frac{1.3E11}{458}$$
$$X_h = 2.8E8$$
