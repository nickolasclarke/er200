##1 Energy economics and emissions​ [25 points] 
 *From Rubin, Problem 13.3 ​ : A 100. MW coal plant wants to add a SO​X​ emissions control system to reduce its emissions. The [emission control system](​https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-07/documents/chapter_5_emission_control_technologies.pdf ) has a capital cost of $747 per kW and reduces SO​X​ emissions by 95% to 0.0929 kg/MWh. Assume the life of the emission control system is 15 years and the power plant produces 550 GWh/y.*

###1a 
*What is the annualized cost of this system in dollars per year if the discount rate (interest rate) is 8.0 percent/year? What if the discount rate is 3.0 percent/year? ​[8 points]*

```python
# Use the Uniform Series Equation
U_008 = {'rate':0.08}
U_003 = {'rate':0.03}

# (747 dollars/1kwh) * (10e3 kw/1mw) * (100 mw) = $747e7
P_dollars = 747 * 10e3 * 100 
n = 15

def U(principal,rate,periods):
    U = principal * (rate / (1 - (1 + rate)**-periods))
    return U

U_008['annualized_cost'] = U(P_dollars,U_008['rate'],n)
U_003['annualized_cost'] = U(P_dollars,U_003['rate'],n)

print("P:$" + str(P_dollars) + "\n U @ 8%:" + str(U_008['annualized_cost']) + "\n U @ 3%:" + str(U_003['annualized_cost']))
```

**ANSWERS:** U at 8%: **$8.7e6 / yr** U @ 3%: **$6.3e6 / yr**

 ##1b
*What is the cost per 9.0 x 10​2​ kWh of electricity usage (the average monthly U.S. residential electricity consumption in 2016) at each of the discount rates specified in part (a)? ​[6 points]*

```python
#find the cost per kwh = annualized cost * (1 / 500 Mwh per year)* (1gwh/1kwh)
U_008['sox_dollar_kwh'] = U_008['annualized_cost'] * (1/550) * (1/10e6)
U_003['sox_dollar_kwh'] = U_003['annualized_cost'] * (1/550) * (1/10e6)

res_consumption_month_kwh = 9.0e2
#multiply by the avg monthly residential consumption: 
U_008['res_monthly_dollar_kwh'] = U_008['sox_dollar_kwh'] * res_consumption_month_kwh
U_003['res_monthly_dollar_kwh'] = U_003['sox_dollar_kwh'] * res_consumption_month_kwh

print("8% Residential Cost: $"+ format(U_008['res_monthly_dollar_kwh'], '.2f') +"/kwh" + "\n" +
    "3% Residential Cost: $"+ format(U_003['res_monthly_dollar_kwh'], '.2f')+"/kwh" )
```

**ANSWERS:**  8% Residential Cost: $14.28/kwh, 3% Residential Cost: $10.24/kwh

 ###1c 
 *What is the cost per metric ton of SO​X​ removed? (1 metric ton = 1,000 kg = 10​6​ g). ​[7 points]*

 ```python
# Annualized cost *  gwh/yr *  gwh/kwh   *  mwh / kg of SOx removed * kg/tonne
U_008['sox_cost_ton'] = U_008['annualized_cost'] * (1/550) * (1 / 1e3) * (1/1.765) * (1e3 / 1) 
U_003['sox_cost_ton'] = U_003['annualized_cost'] * (1/550) * (1 / 1e3) * (1/1.765) * (1e3 / 1)

print("cost per tonne SOx removed @ 8%: $" + format(U_008['sox_cost_ton'], '.1e') 
    + ", @ 3%: " + format(U_003['sox_cost_ton'], '.1e'))
```

**ANSWERS:** cost per tonne SOx removed @ 8%: $9.0e+04, @ 3%: 6.4e+04 <-- off by a factor of 1 w/ nancy

###1d
*A proposed SOx emission limit is 100 ng/J. How much larger are the power plant SOx emissions than the proposed limit before they add the control equipment? Will the plant meet the limit after adding the equipment? [4 points]*

```python

sox_after_kg_wh = 0.0929
total_sox_kwh = (sox_after_kg_wh / 0.05)

ng_kg = 1e9
kwh_j = 1 / 3.6e6
sox_before = total_sox_kwh * ng_kg * kwh_j
sox_after = sox_after_kg_wh * ng_kg * kwh_j

print(" SOx after: " + format(sox_after,'.2g') + "_ng/j")
```

**ANSWERS:**  SOx after: 26 ng/j, yes they will meet the limit.

*Environmental Economics​ [ER200/PP284 only. 24 points]  Imagine you are the governor of a US state and a member of the US Climate Alliance.  You are committed to reducing your state’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in order to achieve goals set out by the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement.  You want to invest in renewables such as wind and solar, but due to the cheap price of natural gas, utilities in your state have no economic incentive to transition to renewables.  Therefore, you would like to account for the social cost of carbon (SCC) and impose a carbon tax on all GHG emissions from energy production.* 

*The table below provides annually-averaged data for two major natural gas-fired power plants currently operating in your state.*

| Plant Name                 | Plant Name Capacity (MW) | Thermal efficiency (%) | Average Annual Capacity Factor | Annual Energy Production (MWh) | Current Price of Energy Production (¢/kWh) |
|:--------------------------:|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Pavillion  (Single Cycle)  | 400.                     | 33.0                   | 0.90                           | 3.154e6                        | 8.1                                        |
| Fairdale  (Combined Cycle) | 450.                     | 54.0                   | 0.90                           | 3.548e6                        | 6.9                                        |

### 2a 
*Assume that natural gas is quantified in terms of its internal energy content in million-Btu, and is estimated to emit roughly 53 kg CO2/million-Btu when combusted (source: USEIA). Therefore, what are the annual CO2 emissions (in tonnes) for each power plant? [6 points]* 
**

```python
pav = {'energy_mwh_yr':3.154e6, 'capacity_mw':400, 'n1_eff':33.0,'cap_fac':0.90, 'cents_kwh': 8.1}
fair = {'energy_mwh_yr':3.548e6, 'capacity_mw':450, 'n1_eff':54.0,'cap_fac':0.90, 'cents_kwh': 6.9}

mbtu_btu = 1 / 1e6
tonne_kg = 1 / 1000

#find fuel input in mwh
pav['total_ng_mwh'] = pav['energy_mwh_yr'] / pav['n1_eff']
fair['total_ng_mwh'] = fair['energy_mwh_yr'] / pav['n1_eff']

# find total kg C02 from the fuel input  
pav['total_co2_tonne'] = pav['total_ng_mwh'] * btu_mwh * mbtu_btu * ng_kg_co2_mbtu * tonne_kg
fair['total_co2_tonne'] = fair['total_ng_mwh'] * btu_mwh * mbtu_btu * ng_kg_co2_mbtu * tonne_kg

print('Pav Annual C02: ' + format(pav['total_co2_tonne'], '.1e') + 
    ', Fair Annual C02: ' + format(fair['total_co2_tonne'],'.1e'))
```

**ANSWERS:** Pav Annual C02: 1.7e+04, Fair Annual C02: 1.9e+04

### 2b 
*Now you want to set a carbon tax on emissions that captures the social cost of carbon.  You decide to set the tax at $40./tonne-CO2.  Using your answers from part a, what will the new cost of energy production be for each of the plants?  If the cost of renewable energy production is 9.0 ¢​/kWh, which plant(s), if any, now have higher production costs than renewables and would therefore be incentivized to transition to clean energy? [6 points]* 
 **

```python
ctax_dollar_tonne_c02 = 40

#find total annual cost of carbon tax
pav['c_tax_dollars'] = pav['total_co2_tonne'] * ctax_dollar_tonne_c02
fair['c_tax_dollars'] = fair['total_co2_tonne'] * ctax_dollar_tonne_c02

#find tonnes of co2 per kwh of input energy
pav['co2_tonne_kwh'] = (pav['total_co2_tonne'])/ (pav['total_ng_mwh'] * 1000)
fair['co2_tonne_kwh'] = (fair['total_co2_tonne'])/ (fair['total_ng_mwh'] * 1000)
#find cost of carbon per kwh
pav['co2_tonne_kwh_dollars'] = ctax_dollar_tonne_c02 * (( pav['total_co2_tonne']) / (pav['total_ng_mwh'] * 1000))
fair['co2_tonne_kwh_dollars'] = ctax_dollar_tonne_c02 * (( fair['total_co2_tonne']) / (fair['total_ng_mwh'] * 1000))

#add cost of co2 tax to production cost
pav['new_cost'] = pav['co2_tonne_kwh_dollars'] + pav['cents_kwh']
fair['new_cost'] = fair['co2_tonne_kwh_dollars'] + fair['cents_kwh'] # < -- THIS ONLY ADDS 7/10ths of a cent, seems wrong. 
```

**ANSWERS:** !**see note above, seems wrong**!

### 2c
*Even if renewables appear to be price competitive compared to natural gas in some instances on a cost per kWh basis, what might prevent or delay a transition to renewable energy production?  Provide at least 3 possible reasons. [6 points]*

**ANSWERS:**

1. Renewables alone are not dispatchable, so even if they are cheaper to run, if you cant actually run it (or not run it) when you need to, than it may not be appropriate to meet the needs of the grid.  
2. Costs of adding storage to make the renewable source dispatchable could push costs above NG costs. 
3. Renewables often need significantly larger footprints than a NG or another plant. This space may not be available in a given locale, such as an island. 

### 2d
*What are some possible drawbacks of employing a statewide carbon tax as the sole strategy to reduce GHG emissions? Provide at least 3 possible reasons. [6 points]*

1. This carbon tax only specifies C02, not other emissions. Uncombusted methane and other GHGes would not be captured, which could be significant contributors to a given state's GHG emissions. 
2. 
3. 


## 3 
*Energy Efficiency​ [30 points] Because you are (of course) feeling inspired by our recent lectures on the potential to save money and energy through efficiency measures, you begin to think about your own energy use at home. You ask your landlady if she is willing to invest in more efficient appliances (she pays the electricity bill). She says she will consider it, but wants to know how much it will cost. You research replacements for your three most electricity-hungry appliances, and these are the best options you can find:*  

 Existing appliances Proposed appliances 
Model kWh/yr Resale Model kWh/yr Price Lifetime 
Fridge A 1020 $110 Fridge B 380 $780 10. yr 
Washer A 510 $45 Washer B 180 $900 16 yr 
Dishwasher A 410 $60. Dishwasher B 240 $350 12 yr 
 
Assume a discount rate of 5.0%, and assume you are able to sell the old appliances on Craigslist at the resale prices above. Assume that the cost of electricity is based on the PG&E price of $0.16/kWh.  
 
a) How much energy (in kWh/yr) would be saved by switching to each of the more efficient appliances? ​[2 points] 
 
b) What is the cost of conserved energy (cents per kWh) for each of these new appliances over its lifetime? ​[6 points] 
 c) Based on your answers above explain in a few sentences which appliance(s) it makes sense for your landlady to invest in? ​[3 points] d) Interest rates tend to be higher in developing countries than in developed countries. Assuming that interest rates and discount rates are equal for simplicity, how would higher interest rates affect the attractiveness of investment for energy efficient technologies in developing countries? ​[5 points] 
 e) Imagine that you are an intern at PG&E researching ways to meet energy demand in Berkeley. Based on your Energy Conservation Cost Curve what would be the total cost savings to society (over the lifetime of the appliances) associated with a program that helps encourage a switch of 15,000 new refrigerators in Berkeley next year? ​[4 points] 
 f) Think about how such a program might be structured, and remember that not all landlords include utilities in their rent (which is an example of the “landlord-tenant” problem, a special case of what in lecture we defined as principal-agent problems). How could PG&E encourage landlords that do not pay the utilities to make a switch to these more efficient appliances? ​[6 points] 
 
g) Briefly discuss one cost and one benefit that are not incorporated into your analysis of the cost of conserved energy. You do not need to provide a quantitative assessment. ​[4 points]  
   
Problem 4. Life-Cycle Analysis of Biofuels​ [15 points] In an effort to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its transportation sector, the European Union (EU) began to mandate the increasing use of (mostly food-based) biofuels as a partial substitute for fossil fuels in 2003.  However, a number of studies in recent years have suggested that the true level of GHG emissions associated with biofuels production may be greater than originally estimated once the indirect land-use change effects of the industry are taken into account.  The market incentive to increase production of crops for biofuel (e.g. palm oil, maize, soya bean, sugar cane etc.) can lead to the conversion of forests, wetlands, or peatlands to intensive agriculture, which both reduces the land’s carbon sequestration potential and increases its GHG emissions. 2 The figure below compares estimates of GHG emissions associated with multiple biofuel crops in terms of direct emissions, as well as when accounting for emissions associated with indirect land-use changes.  Use this figure to answer parts a-d. 
 
Figure 1 ​ (Source: IFPRI) 
 a) Based on Figure 1, if one were to compare fossil fuels and biofuels solely in terms of their direct emissions, which biofuel crops appear to provide a reduction in GHG emissions as compared to fossil fuels (note that the value for fossil fuels in the above graph is a direct emissions number)?  Which provides the most direct emissions savings per MJ compared to fossil fuels?  The least? [3 points] 
2 From Van Noorden, R., EU Debates U-Turn on Biofuels Policy. Nature, 01 July 2018 

 b) Approximately what is this reduction (in g CO​2​ eq/MJ) for palm oil? How about for maize? [2 points] 
 
c) When accounting for ILUC effects, which sources of biofuels still provide GHG emissions reduction benefits? [2 points] 
d) Now, what is the approximate difference between palm oil and maize biofuels compared to fossil fuels in terms of life-cycle GHG emissions (in g CO​2​ eq/MJ). [2 points] 
 While Figure 1 provides a single set of estimates for direct and indirect (life-cycle) emissions associated with the production of different biofuels, life-cycle estimates will vary across scientific studies.  A 2015 report by the University of Tennessee reveals the wide diversity of estimates made by different studies regarding the potential GHG emissions reductions just for maize (corn)-based ethanol while accounting for land-use change (LUC). ​Figure 2 below illustrates 3 these differences.
 
Figure 2 ​ (Source: Univ. of Tennessee) 
 e) Using the information in Figure 2, discuss some potential reasons for such widespread disagreement between studies regarding the life-cycle GHG emissions of corn ethanol.  Cite at least 3 possible reasons. (Note: Negative values in figure 2 represent higher life-cycle GHG emissions (negative reductions) of corn ethanol compared to gasoline, while positive values indicate lower life-cycle GHG emissions, or positive reductions) ​ .
