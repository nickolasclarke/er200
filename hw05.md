## 1 Energy economics and emissions​ [25 points]

In this question, we ask you to explore the load profiles of campus buildings versus residence
halls, and to reflect on and quantify some of your daily individual energy use. We will examine
the Haas School of Business, Barrows Hall, Residence Hall 3, and the Recreational Sports
Facility. To access energy data, go to:
<https://us.pulseenergy.com/UniCalBerkeley/dashboard/#/overview>

For Residence Hall 3, you will need to navigate to the housing dashboard page to access data:
<https://us.pulseenergy.com/UCBHousing/dashboard/#/overview>

### 1a - f

- a. Look at a daily load profile for each building. Be sure to report the date and the day of the week you are looking at. Approximately what time does energy use peak in each building and what is the peak load (in kW)? (2 points)
- b. What time does energy use bottom out in each building and at what load (in kW)?  (2 points)
- c. What is the peak energy use per ft​2​ of each building (in W/ft​2​)? (2 points)
- d. What are three possible explanations for the differences in 1c? Why are certain buildings using more or less energy/ft​2​? (3 points)
- e. Look at a weekly load profile for each building. Is the peak load for each building higher during the week or on the weekend? Why? (4 points)
- f. For the residence hall, what is the peak energy use/resident (in W/person)? What is the ‘baseload’ use/resident? (2 points)

**ANSWERS:** Rolling 24hr period, not calendar day

- Hass
  - A: 10/24 16:00 = 548 kW
  - B: 10/24 00:00 = 197 kW
  - C: `( 548  * 1000 ) / 238270  = ~2.3 watts`
  - D:
    1. Some of the buildings are signficantly older than others, so installed hardware may not be as efficent, and building envelope may not be as tight, leaning to large inefficencies, i.e. Barrows.
    2. The types of loads at each of these buildings are very different. Hass, has both very aggressive heating and cooling, computer labs, and a library. Barrows, which as no active cooling, and is mostly comprised of offices that mostly have windows occupied during daylight hours, doesnt require the same amount of absolute power.
    3. The occupancy of each of these buildings is very different as well. Some are occupied at pretty constant rate, while others are only occupied for during working hours.
  - E: Weekday, no residential / dining use, fewer classes and occupants on weekends.
- Barrows:
  - A: 10/24 11:00 = 228 kW
  - B: 10/24 03:30 = 104 kW
  - C: `( 228 * 1000) / 198294 = ~1.15 watts`  #(peak_kw * w_kw conversion) / sq_ft
  - D: see above
  - E: Weekday, mostly offices, no residential / dining use, few occupants on weekends.
- Residential Hall 3:
  - A: 10/29 232 kW
  - B: 10/30 137 kW
  - C: `(232 * 1000 ) / 212654 = ~1.09 watts`  #(peak_kw * w_kw conversion) / sq_ft
  - D: see above
  - E: Peak load is pretty consistent through the week. This matches with the assumed occupancy, which should be consistent through the school year, with students occupying the building every day and some percentage of them present 24x7
  - F: `4 towers * 230 per tower  = 920 students`
    - Peak Use: `232,000 W / 920 students = ~250 W/student`
    - Baseload: `137,000 W / 920 students = ~150 W/student`

- Recreational Sports Facility:
  - A: 10/24 10:00 = 165 kW
  - B: 10/24 03:00 = 50 kW
  - C: `( 165 * 1000)  / 252597 = ~0.65 watts` #(peak_kw * w_kw conversion) / sq_ft
  - D: see above
  - E: fairly even through the week, slight dip on weekends. Residential-like use. Students living on or near campus use the gym outside of working hours. Higher week use is probably due to those who are only on campus during the week (i.e. professors, professional staff), also using / working in the gym during the work week.

Think about your own peak energy consumption during the day. When do you anticipate that your peak electricity consumption is highest (i.e. during what hour of the day does your rate of electricity consumption peak? Think about things like lighting, refrigeration, electric heat, computer, electric tea kettle, laundry machine, etc…. Investigate the power draw of each of these devices that you would be using at the peak time and sum them to calculate your ‘peak’ rate of daily power consumption (show your work and state assumptions!). How does your number compare to the peak W/resident in 1.f? (5 points)

```python
appliances_peak = {
  'fridge_w': 150,
  'wifi_router_w': 25,
  'microwave_w': 1300,
  'lighting_w': 250,
  'computer1_w': 200,
  'computer2_w': 200,
  'computer3_w': 800,
  'dishwasher_w': 216,
  'washer_w': 1200,
  'dryer_w': 5400
}
occupants = 3

#sum all the different loads
def find_load_w(loads):
  peak_w = 0
  for key,value in loads.items():
    peak_w += value
  return peak_w

peak_w = find_load_w(appliances_peak)
#divide total peak power by occupants
peak_p_occupant = peak_w / occupants

print('Peak power: ' + format(peak_w,'.2g')  + ' W\nPeak per occupant: ' + format(peak_p_occupant,'.2g')+ ' W')

```

**ANSWERS:**

- Peak power: 1e+04
- Peak per occupant: 3e+03

While our potential peak is significantly higher than that seen in the Residential hall, it would require all of the listed appliances to be turned on at the same time, which is unlikely, but possible. It would likely be for a very short period of time. Howevever, the major loads come from washing/drying and cooking/food preservation, which is either not often found in the resident halls and thus not counted towards the residents "domestic" energy use, or is shared by a much larger number of people, which is obviously more efficient.

### 1h

Now think about your household electricity consumption while you are ​not ​ at home. What devices are left on while you are gone? Estimate the power draw of each of these devices and sum them to calculate your ‘baseload’ rate of daily energy consumption (show your work!). How does your number compare to the ‘baseload’ W/resident in 1.f? (5 points)

```python
appliances_base = {
  'fridge_w': 150,
  'wifi_router_w': 25
  }

baseload_w = find_load_w(appliances_base)
baseload_w_p_occupant = baseload_w / occupants

print('Baseload power: ' + format(baseload_w,'.2g')  + ' W\nBaseload per occupant: ' + format(baseload_w_p_occupant,'.2g')+ ' W')

```

**ANSWERS:**

- Baseload power: ~180 W
- Baseload per occupant: ~58 W

Baseload per occupant is nearly 1/3 of that of the residential hall nbaseload/person. This is likely due to a much lower share of "common" loads, such as hallway lighting, any HVAC load, and perhaps a more even distribution of load fromo common appliances/goods being used by residents instead of sitting idle, which is also overall more efficient.

### 1i

Assume you are away from your home for an average of 5 hours/day. If your ‘baseload’ rate from question 1.h stays consistent, what is your total amount of electricity per year consumed while you are not home? Assuming an average PG&E emissions factor of 430 lbs CO2/MWh, how many pounds of CO2/year does this amount to? If you assume an average US emissions factor for electricity generation of 1100 lbs CO2/MWh, how much does this amount to? (3 points)

```python
pge_co2_mwh = 430
us_co2_mwh = 1100
#calc mwh of baseload / yr @ 5hrs a day
baseload_yr_mwh = baseload_w * (5*365) / 1e6
#calc CO2 emissions in pounds for each emission factor per person
baseload_pge_co2_lbs = baseload_yr_mwh * pge_co2_mwh / occupants
baseload_us_co2_lbs = baseload_yr_mwh * us_co2_mwh / occupants
print('PGE: ' + format(baseload_pge_co2_lbs,'.2g') + ' lbs/person \nUS: ' + format(baseload_us_co2_lbs,'.2g') + ' lbs/person')
```

**ANSWERS:**

- PGE: 46 lbs/person
- US: 1.2e+02 lbs/person

The Pacific Intertie is a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) connection between the Pacific Northwest and California, designed to take advantage of hydroelectric power to meet electricity demand in Southern California. The HVDC connection transmits electricity from the Dalles Dam in Oregon to Los Angeles. The Dalles Dam has a nameplate capacity of 1,870 MW. A 845 mile HVDC power line connects the dam to the Los Angeles area. Because of the differences in weather patterns and electricity demand in the two regions, the Dalles Dam supplies energy to the Los Angeles area during the summer across the HVDC line, when demand in Southern California is high and water from snowmelt in the Northwest is usually plentiful.

### 2a

When dams produce electricity, they use a generator to convert hydraulic motion to alternating current (AC) power. Before this power is transmitted via the Pacific Intertie, an HVDC converter station is used to convert that AC power from the dam to DC power. What is one benefit and one drawback of the current design of the Pacific Intertie, where DC power is transmitted instead of AC power? [2 points]

**ANSWERS:**

- **Benefit:** HVDC allows for less power losses over long distances, making for a more cost effective and efficient way to move power at distance.
- **Drawback:** The system has to be rectified and inverted twice more, adding significant additional complexity to the system, which could impact maintence costs as well as reliability.

### 2b

When the Pacific Intertie was first constructed in 1965, electricity was transmitted at a voltage of 800. kV. How much current (in amps) flowed through the transmission line when the dam was producing its rated power? [2 points

```python
P_w = 1870e6
V_65_v = 800e3
I_65_amps = P_w / V_65_v

print(format(I_65_amps, '.4g') + " A")
```

**ANSWERS:** 234 A

### 2c

In 2012, the HVDC converter station (which converts AC power from the dam to DC power for transmission) was upgraded to its current voltage of 1120 kV. How much current (in amps) currently flows through the transmission line when the dam is producing its rated power? [2 points]

```python
V_12_v = 1120e3
I_12_amps = P_w / V_12_v

print(format(I_12_amps, '.4g') + " A")
```

**ANSWERS:** 1670 A

### 2d

The resistance of a transmission line is proportional to its length (assuming for simplicity that temperature is constant). Assume that between 1965 and 2012, the Pacific Intertie used the same material for the transmission line, which had a resistance of 2.00 x 10​-3​ Ω per 1000. feet. What is the total resistance of the transmission line? [3 points]

```python
distance_mi = 845
R_ohm_1000_ft = 2.00e-3 / 1000
ft_mi = 5280 / 1

total_R = R_ohm_1000_ft * ft_mi * distance_mi

print('Total Resistance: ' + format(total_R,'.3g') + ' ohm')

```

**ANSWERS:** Total Resistance 8.92 ohm

### 2e

*When the Dalles Dam is producing its rated power, how much power loss was there in the transmission line in 1965? How about after the upgrade in 2012? Report your answers in MW.*

```python
#P_loss = I^2 * R
P_loss_65_mw = ((I_65_amps**2) * total_R) / 1e6
P_loss_12_mw = ((I_12_amps**2) * total_R) / 1e6

print('Power Losses in 1965: ' + format(P_loss_65_mw, '.3g') + ' mW')
print('Power Losses in 2012: ' + format(P_loss_12_mw, '.3g') + ' mW')

```

**ANSWERS:**

- Power Losses in 1965: ~48.8 mW
- Power Losses in 2012: ~24.9 mW

### 2f

What percentage of the dam’s rated power was lost in transmission in 1965? In 2012? [2 points]

```python
#convert from mW to W and find percentage of total Power.
P_loss_65_perc = ((P_loss_65_mw) * 1e6 ) / P_w
P_loss_12_perc = ((P_loss_12_mw) * 1e6 ) / P_w
print('1965 Power loss: '+ format(P_loss_65_perc,'.2%'))
print('2012 Power loss: '+ format(P_loss_12_perc,'.2%'))
```

**ANSWERS:**

- 1965 Power loss: 2.61%
- 2012 Power loss: 1.33%

### 2g

Based on your answer to part (f), explain the relationship between voltage and power loss. [2 points]

**ANSWERS:** Since `P_loss = I^2 * R` and since `I = P / V`, as we increase voltage, and `P` and `R` remain constant, P_loss decreases. Thus P_loss and voltage are inversely related.

### 2h

*Electricity demand in the Los Angeles area is 3,000 MW from 1 am to 7 am; 4,500 MW from 7 am to 12 pm; 5,500 MW from 12 pm to 9 pm; and 4,000 MW from 9 pm to 1 am.

Assume the Dalles Dam provides all of its generated electricity to the Los Angeles area and only accounts for 25% of the Los Angeles area electricity supply at any given time.

Calculate the capacity factor for the hydroelectric facility over one day, accounting for the loss in power incurred during transmission of electricity using the values for transmission power loss calculated for the 2012 system in part (e). [8 points]

The Monterrey/Santos formation, an area encompassing 1,800 square miles in southern California, is estimated to contain the largest reserve of shale oil in the United States. Total “technically recoverable resources” (based on current technology, irrespective of cost) in this formation has been estimated at 600 million barrels of oil. To optimally extract this oil over a twenty-year timespan, sixteen wells per square mile would be constructed and hydraulic fracturing methods would be used on average 1.7 times over the lifetime of the well.

## 3a

Assuming uniform distribution of the oil in the shale formation, how many wells would need to be constructed and how much oil would each well extract?   (4 points)

```python
montsan = {
  'area_mi': 1800,
  'oil_barrels': 600e6,
  'time_yr': 20,
  'wells_sq_mi': 16,
  'frack_rate': 1.7
  }

montsan['total_wells'] =  montsan['area_mi'] * montsan['wells_sq_mi']
montsan['oil_per_well'] = montsan['oil_barrels'] / montsan['total_wells']

print('Total wells: ' + format(montsan['total_wells'], '.1e'))
print('Barrels of oil per well: ' + format(montsan['oil_per_well'], '.0e'))
```

**ANSWERS:**

- Total wells: 2.9e+04
- Barrels of Oil per Well: 2e+04

### 3b

If each well requires on average 5 million gallons of freshwater each time the shale is fractured, how much water will be required per year to continue oil production?  If the Kern River, which flows at an average rate of 900 ft​3​/sec, is used as the primary water source for this operation, what percentage of the river’s flow will be used?  (6 points)

```python
ft3_gal = 1 / 7.48
sec_year = 3.154e+7

montsan['frac_h2o_gal'] = 5e6
# find H2O per year
montsan['h2o_year'] = montsan['frac_h2o_gal'] * montsan['frack_rate'] * montsan['total_wells'] / montsan['time_yr']
# convert to ft^3 / sec
montsan['h2o_ft3_sec'] = montsan['h2o_year'] * ft3_gal / sec_year

kern = { 'flow_ft3_sec': 900}
#find ratio
kern['fracking_h2o_p'] = montsan['h2o_ft3_sec'] / kern['flow_ft3_sec']

print('Gal of freshwater / year: ' + format(montsan['h2o_year'],'.0e'))
print(format(kern['fracking_h2o_p'],'.0%') + ' of Kern River water consumed' )
```

**ANSWERS:**

- Gal of freshwater / year: 1e+10
- 6% of Kern River water consumed

### 3c

If 25% of each barrel (1 barrel = 42 gallons) of oil can be turned into gasoline, how many total vehicle miles are “contained” in the Monterey/Santos oil shale play? How much emitted CO​2​ does this represent, in tonnes? State your assumptions with clear references, and express your answer with 2 significant figures. (5 points)

```python
gal_barrel = 42
avg_mpg = 25.2
avg_g_co2_mi = 352
montsan['total_miles'] = montsan['oil_barrels'] * gal_barrel * avg_mpg * 0.25
montsan['total_co2_tonnes'] = montsan['total_miles'] * avg_g_co2_mi / 1e6
print('Total miles: ' + format(montsan['total_miles'],'.1e'))
print('Total CO2: ' + format(montsan['total_co2_tonnes'],'.1e') + ' tonnes')
```

 **ANSWERS:**

- Total miles: 2e+11
- Total CO2: 6e+07 tonnes

In 2003, a group of researchers at MIT published a report called “The Future of Coal”, which you can access here: ​<http://web.mit.edu/coal/​.>

One of the key conclusions that the report reaches is that “if carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is successfully adopted, utilization of coal likely will expand even with stabilization of CO​2 emissions” (pg. 14). Suppose this future is realized - CCS technologies become economically and technologically viable to install at the majority of coal power plants. As a policy-maker, you are considering enacting measures to encourage the adoption of CCS, knowing that it will lead to stabilized CO​2​ emissions and an increase in coal usage. In two paragraphs, explain what considerations you might have when it comes to the implementation and potential consequences of encouraging CCS usage. [10 points]

 **ANSWERS:**

Broadly implementing CCS across the fleet of Coal-fired power plants could potentially be seen as the most attractive solution to addressing our climate goals rapidly with minimal disturbance to our high-energy lifestyle and the electrical industry that helps enable that. We have a well developed supply-chain and infrastructure to support the use of coal, making it easy to deploy. The US also has extensive reserves of domestic coal, that could be used domestically (further energy independence) as well as become an attractive export to other nations that would implement CCS to their coal-fleets, such as China and India, that have large coal-fired assets. It would also ensure an easy and cost effective way to maintain even baseload power.

However, there are potential downfalls to the expansion of coal even with CCS. It puts even more political and economic capital into a highly-centralized system that would be even more sensitive to price changes in coal, or disruption from new technologies that don't require the additional overhead of CCS. Perhaps most importantly, CCS does not account for the other significant enviromental impacts that burning coal has on our local and global environment. Regardless of CO2 emissions, coal is also is a primary contributor to air and water pollution (particulate, heavy metals, etc) that has major impacts on human health. Common extraction techniques also have major impact on local habitats that are often irreseversable, such as strip mining and mountaintop removal.

It is time to start thinking about the policy memo that will make up your last written assignment for the class (due Monday, December 4). A policy memo is a recommendation that you are making to a real government official (or other relevant audience) on a topic you have chosen to advocate or analyze. Read the sample policy memo that is posted on the class website to get an idea of what your final product should look like. The final deliverable for undergraduates will be 4 pages, while the graduate deliverable will be 8 pages.  For graduate students: while your memos are longer, the same structure has proven to be highly useful in the real world.  Please still keep your ‘bumper sticker to as close to ‘tweet’ length as possible (280 characters). However, think about a memo that is 2 - 4 pages long (if you’re an undergraduate student) or up to 8 pages long (if you’re a graduate student) depending on how much supplemental material you find needed.  A 4 or 8 page ​narrative ​ is still long, and ideally can be avoided, unless your case, or the theory, is particularly challenging to lay out.

Give the “bumper sticker” version of your policy memo, i.e., a concise, one-sentence version of your recommendation, including which government official or relevant audience your memo is targeted toward. (Note: you do not have to commit to the policy you choose here for your policy memo – we just want you to get started on thinking about what you might want to write about).
