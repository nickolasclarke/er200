## 1 Energy economics and emissions​ [25 points] 
In this question, we ask you to explore the load profiles of campus buildings versus residence
halls, and to reflect on and quantify some of your daily individual energy use. We will examine
the Haas School of Business, Barrows Hall, Residence Hall 3, and the Recreational Sports
Facility. To access energy data, go to:

### 1a - f 
- a. Look at a daily load profile for each building. Be sure to report the date and the day of the week you are looking at. Approximately what time does energy use peak in each building and what is the peak load (in kW)? (2 points) 
- b. What time does energy use bottom out in each building and at what load (in kW)?  (2 points) 
- c. What is the peak energy use per ft​2​ of each building (in W/ft​2​)? (2 points) 
- d. What are three possible explanations for the differences in 1c? Why are certain buildings using more or less energy/ft​2​? (3 points)
- e. Look at a weekly load profile for each building. Is the peak load for each building higher during the week or on the weekend? Why? (4 points) 
- f. For the residence hall, what is the peak energy use/resident (in W/person)? What is the ‘baseload’ use/resident? (2 points)

**ANSWERS:** Rolling 24hr period, not calendar day
- Hass
    - A: 10/24 16:00 = 548 kW
    - B: 10/24 00:00 = 197 kW 
    - C: `( 548  * 1000 ) / 238270  = ~2.3 watts`
    - D:
      1. Some of the buildings are signficantly older than others, so installed hardware may not be as efficent, and building envelope may not be as tight, leaning to large inefficencies, i.e. Barrows. 
      2. The types of loads at each of these buildings are very different. Hass, has both very aggressive heating and cooling, computer labs, and a library. Barrows, which as no active cooling, and is mostly comprised of offices that mostly have windows occupied during daylight hours, doesnt require the same amount of absolute power.
      3. The occupancy of each of these buildings is very different as well. Some are occupied at pretty constant rate, while others are only occupied for during working hours.
    - E: Weekday, no residential / dining use, fewer classes and occupants on weekends. 
- Barrows:
   - A: 10/24 11:00 = 228 kW
   - B: 10/24 03:30 = 104 kW
   - C: `( 228 * 1000) / 198294 = ~1.15 watts`  #(peak_kw * w_kw conversion) / sq_ft 
   - D: see above
   - E: Weekday, mostly offices, no residential / dining use, few occupants on weekends. 
- Residential Hall 3:
   - A: 10/29 232 kW 
   - B: 10/30 137 kW
   - C: `(232 * 1000 ) / 212654 = ~1.09 watts`  #(peak_kw * w_kw conversion) / sq_ft 
   - D: see above
   - E: Peak load is pretty consistent through the week. This matches with the assumed occupancy, which should be consistent through the school year, with students occupying the building every day and some percentage of them present 24x7
   - F: **!!!!!!**
 - Recreational Sports Facility:
   - A: 10/24 10:00 = 165 kW 
   - B: 10/24 03:00 = 50 kW
   - C: `( 165 * 1000)  / 252597 = ~0.65 watts` #(peak_kw * w_kw conversion) / sq_ft 
   - D: see above
   - E: fairly even through the week, slight dip on weekends. Residential-like use. Students living on or near campus use the gym outside of working hours. Higher week use is probably due to those who are only on campus during the week (i.e. professors, professional staff), also using / working in the gym during the work week.

**ANSWERS:**

## 2
*The Pacific Intertie is a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) connection between the Pacific Northwest and California, designed to take advantage of hydroelectric power to meet electricity demand in Southern California. The HVDC connection transmits electricity from the Dalles Dam in Oregon to Los Angeles. The Dalles Dam has a nameplate capacity of 1,870 MW. A 845 mile HVDC power line connects the dam to the Los Angeles area. Because of the differences in weather patterns and electricity demand in the two regions, the Dalles Dam supplies energy to the Los Angeles area during the summer across the HVDC line, when demand in Southern California is high and water from snowmelt in the Northwest is usually plentiful.*


### 2a 
*When dams produce electricity, they use a generator to convert hydraulic motion to alternating current (AC) power. Before this power is transmitted via the Pacific Intertie, an HVDC converter station is used to convert that AC power from the dam to DC power. What is one benefit and one drawback of the current design of the Pacific Intertie, where DC power is transmitted instead of AC power? [2 points]*

**ANSWERS:** 
Benefit: HVDC allows for less power losses over long distances, making for a more cost effective and efficient way to move power at distance.
Drawback: The system has to be rectified and inverted twice more, adding significant additional complexity to the system.

### 2b
*When the Pacific Intertie was first constructed in 1965, electricity was transmitted at a voltage of 800. kV. How much current (in amps) flowed through the transmission line when the dam was producing its rated power? [2 points* 

```python
P_w = 1870e6
V_v = 800e3
I_ac_amps = P_w / V_v

print(format(I_ac_amps, '.4g') + " A")
```

**ANSWERS:** 2338 A

### 2c
*In 2012, the HVDC converter station (which converts AC power from the dam to DC power for transmission) was upgraded to its current voltage of 1120 kV. How much current (in amps) currently flows through the transmission line when the dam is producing its rated power? [2 points]*

```python
P_w = 1870e6
V_v = 1120e3
I_hvdc_amps = P_w / V_v

print(format(I_hvdc_amps, '.4g') + " A")
```

**ANSWERS:** 1670 A

### 2d
*The resistance of a transmission line is proportional to its length (assuming for simplicity that temperature is constant). Assume that between 1965 and 2012, the Pacific Intertie used the same material for the transmission line, which had a resistance of 2.00 x 10​-3​ Ω per 1000. feet. What is the total resistance of the transmission line? [3 points]*

```python
distance_mi = 845
resisitance_ohms_1000_ft = 2.00e-3

total_ft = 4.4e6

```

**ANSWERS:**

 ### 3e 
 *Imagine that you are an intern at PG&E researching ways to meet energy demand in Berkeley.  What would be the total cost savings to society (over the lifetime of the appliances) associated with a program that helps encourage a switch of 15,000 new refrigerators in Berkeley next year? ​[4 points]*

 ```python
 ```
**ANSWERS:**

 ### 3f
 *Think about how such a program might be structured, and remember that not all landlords include utilities in their rent (which is an example of the “landlord-tenant” problem, a special case of what in lecture we defined as principal-agent problems). How could PG&E encourage landlords that do not pay the utilities to make a switch to these more efficient appliances? ​[6 points]* 

 **ANSWERS:**

### 3g
*Briefly discuss one cost and one benefit that are not incorporated into your analysis of the cost of conserved energy. You do not need to provide a quantitative assessment. ​[4 points]*

## 4 
*Life-Cycle Analysis of Biofuels​ [15 points] In an effort to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its transportation sector, the European Union (EU) began to mandate the increasing use of (mostly food-based) biofuels as a partial substitute for fossil fuels in 2003.  However, a number of studies in recent years have suggested that the true level of GHG emissions associated with biofuels production may be greater than originally estimated once the indirect land-use change effects of the industry are taken into account.  The market incentive to increase production of crops for biofuel (e.g. palm oil, maize, soya bean, sugar cane etc.) can lead to the conversion of forests, wetlands, or peatlands to intensive agriculture, which both reduces the land’s carbon sequestration potential and increases its GHG emissions. 2 The figure below compares estimates of GHG emissions associated with multiple biofuel crops in terms of direct emissions, as well as when accounting for emissions associated with indirect land-use changes.  Use this figure to answer parts a-d.* 
 
*See Figure 1 ​ in handout (Source: IFPRI)*

 ### 4a 
 *Based on Figure 1, if one were to compare fossil fuels and biofuels solely in terms of their direct emissions, which biofuel crops appear to provide a reduction in GHG emissions as compared to fossil fuels (note that the value for fossil fuels in the above graph is a direct emissions number)?  Which provides the most direct emissions savings per MJ compared to fossil fuels?  The least? [3 points]*
 
 **ANSWERS:**

 ### 4b 
 *Approximately what is this reduction (in g CO​2​ eq/MJ) for palm oil? How about for maize? [2 points]* 
 
**ANSWERS:**

### 4c 
*When accounting for ILUC effects, which sources of biofuels still provide GHG emissions reduction benefits? [2 points]*

**ANSWERS:**

### 4d
*Now, what is the approximate difference between palm oil and maize biofuels compared to fossil fuels in terms of life-cycle GHG emissions (in g CO​2​ eq/MJ). [2 points]*

**ANSWERS:**

 ### 4e
 *While Figure 1 provides a single set of estimates for direct and indirect (life-cycle) emissions associated with the production of different biofuels, life-cycle estimates will vary across scientific studies.  A 2015 report by the University of Tennessee reveals the wide diversity of estimates made by different studies regarding the potential GHG emissions reductions just for maize (corn)-based ethanol while accounting for land-use change (LUC). ​Figure 2 below illustrates these differences.*

*SEE FIGURE TWO IN HANDOUT*

*Using the information in Figure 2, discuss some potential reasons for such widespread disagreement between studies regarding the life-cycle GHG emissions of corn ethanol.  Cite at least 3 possible reasons. (Note: Negative values in figure 2 represent higher life-cycle GHG emissions (negative reductions) of corn ethanol compared to gasoline, while positive values indicate lower life-cycle GHG emissions, or positive reductions) .
