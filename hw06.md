## 1 Comparing PV costs across the US [25 points]

### 1a
Let us consider a simple 15 m^2 rooftop installation of crystalline-silicon (c-Si) PV modules. Remember that PV modules are rated to receive 1.0 kW/m^2 ‚Äãof solar radiation. Assuming peak solar irradiance of 1.0 kW/m^2, what would the peak output of this system be (in kW) if the modules are 21% efficient? [2 points]

 ```python
def oneA():
    roof = {'area_m2':15}
    eff = 0.21
    irradiance_w_m2 = 1.0
    roof['peak_kW'] = roof['area_m2'] * eff
    return print('Peak kW: ', format(roof['peak_kW'],'.2f'))

oneA()
 ```

**ANSWERS:** Peak kW:  3.15

### 1b

Compute the annualized cost for this type of PV module (in $/year) using the values below from the SunShot Vision Study (2011), assuming for simplicity that operating costs can be ignored. Assume a 5.0% discount rate and 25-year lifetime. [3 points]

| Initial Cost                 | Unit        | Value ($USD) |
|------------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Module cost                  | $/Watt_peak | 0.54         |
| Permitting & Inspection cost | $/Watt_peak | 0.84         |
| Installation labor cost      | $/Watt_peak | 1.00         |
| Inverter Cost                | $/Watt_peak | 0.12         |

```python
def oneB():
    #costs in $/Watt_peak
    costs = {
        'items': {
            'module':0.54,
            'pi': 0.84,
            'install': 1.00,
            'inverter':0.12
            },
            'total': 0
            }
    #add up all the costs
    for item, price in costs['items'].items():
        costs['total'] += price
    # find the annualized cost per W_peak
    def U_series(P, n, r):
        n = n
        discount_r = r
        U = costs['total'] * ( discount_r / ( 1 - ( 1 + discount_r)**-n) )
        return U
    #store and print answer, with sigfigs
    costs['ann_cost'] = U_series(costs['total'], 25, 0.05)
    return print('annualized cost: ', format(costs['ann_cost'],'.2f'), ' USD / year / W_peak')


```

**ANSWERS:**

### 1c

Consider how much electricity the PV system from 1.a will be able to generate in different cities based on variation in insolation levels. Ignore your answer to 1.b using the SunShot Goal values, and assume an annualized cost of this type of PV module to be $610/year today, with the same module efficiency of 21%. Calculate the (i) annual electricity generated by the PV system and (ii) the levelized cost of solar energy in a) San Francisco, CA (1,800 kWh/m‚Äã2‚Äã-year); b) New York City, NY (1,280 kWh/m‚Äã2‚Äã-year); c) Detroit, MI (1,310 kWh/m‚Äã2‚Äã-year); and d) Flagstaff, AZ (2,300 kWh/m‚Äã2‚Äã-year). [8 points]

```python
def oneC():
#Irradiance in kwh/m2/year
eff = 0.21
#annualized cost in $
U = 610
irradiance = {
    'sf': 1800,
    'nyc': 1280,
    'dtw': 1310,
    'flg': 2300
    }

E_yr = {}
# for each city, ( Power X efficency ) X hrs/year
for city, power in irradiance.items():
    E_yr[city] = (power * eff) * 8760
    #
lcoe = {}

for city, energy in E_yr.items():
    lcoe[city] = U / energy


```

### 1d

Compare your results in 1.c to the average residential electricity rates in each of these cities. In which cities is electricity from PV more expensive or cheaper than retail rates? [2 points]

Average residential rates (‚Äã¬¢/kWh)
| San Francisco | New York | Detroit | Flagstaff |
|---------------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 13.8          | 14.5     | 9.40    | 11.3      |

```python
```

### 1e

Calculate the simple payback period for your solar system in San Francisco (assuming net metering). Ignoring your results from 1.a and 1.c, assume peak output of the system to be 2.5 kW, annual electricity generated by the PV system to be 4,900 kWh, and that your household consumes 15,000 kWh/year. [4 points]

```python
#Simple Payback (ùë¶ùëü) = ( ‚àÜCosts_USD / Savings_USD_ùë¶ùëü)
def oneF():
    P_peak_kw = 2.5
    E_yr_kwh = 4900
    h_consp_kwh = 15000

    def simple_payback(costs, savings)
```

### 1f

How might our results for the levelized cost of PV electricity differ if we were considering utility-scale installations instead of residential-scale rooftop installations? List and explain three other factors we would have to consider AND discuss three limitations to the model that we devised for calculating the levelized cost of electricity. [6 points]
