## 1 Comparing PV costs across the US [25 points]

### 1a
Let us consider a simple 15 m^2 rooftop installation of crystalline-silicon (c-Si) PV modules. Remember that PV modules are rated to receive 1.0 kW/m^2 ​of solar radiation. Assuming peak solar irradiance of 1.0 kW/m^2, what would the peak output of this system be (in kW) if the modules are 21% efficient? [2 points]

 ```python
def oneA():
    roof = {'area_m2':15}
    eff = 0.21
    irradiance_w_m2 = 1.0
    roof['peak_kw'] = roof['area_m2'] * eff
    print('Peak kW: ', format(roof['peak_kw'],'.1e'))
    return roof

oneA()
 ```

**ANSWERS:** Peak kW:  3.2

### 1b

Compute the annualized cost for this type of PV module (in $/year) using the values below from the SunShot Vision Study (2011), assuming for simplicity that operating costs can be ignored. Assume a 5.0% discount rate and 25-year lifetime. [3 points]

| Initial Cost                 | Unit        | Value ($USD) |
|------------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Module cost                  | $/Watt_peak | 0.54         |
| Permitting & Inspection cost | $/Watt_peak | 0.84         |
| Installation labor cost      | $/Watt_peak | 1.00         |
| Inverter Cost                | $/Watt_peak | 0.12         |

```python
def oneB(roof):
    #costs in $/Watt_peak
    costs = {
        'items': {
            'module':0.54,
            'pi': 0.84,
            'install': 1.00,
            'inverter':0.12
            },
            'total': 0
            }
    #add up all the costs
    for item, price in costs['items'].items():
        costs['total'] += price
    # find the annualized cost per W_peak using n = 25 and r = 0.05
    def U_series(P, n, r):
        n = n
        discount_r = r
        U = P * ( discount_r / ( 1 - ( 1 + discount_r)**-n) )
        return U
    #store and print answer, with sigfigs
    P = costs['total'] * (roof['peak_kw'] * 1000)
    costs['ann_cost'] = U_series(P, 25, 0.05)
    return print('annualized cost: ', format(costs['ann_cost'],'.1e'), ' $ / yr')

oneB(oneA())

```

**ANSWERS:** annualized cost:  5.6e+02  $ / yr

### 1c

Consider how much electricity the PV system from 1.a will be able to generate in different cities based on variation in insolation levels. Ignore your answer to 1.b using the SunShot Goal values, and assume an annualized cost of this type of PV module to be $610/year today, with the same module efficiency of 21%. Calculate the (i) annual electricity generated by the PV system and (ii) the levelized cost of solar energy in a) San Francisco, CA (1,800 kWh/m​2​-year); b) New York City, NY (1,280 kWh/m​2​-year); c) Detroit, MI (1,310 kWh/m​2​-year); and d) Flagstaff, AZ (2,300 kWh/m​2​-year).

    # for each city, ( Power X efficency ) X size X hrs/year
    for city, power in irradiance.items():
        E_yr[city] = (power * roof['peak_kw'])
    #calc LCOE

### 1f

How might our results for the levelized cost of PV electricity differ if we were considering utility-scale installations instead of residential-scale rooftop installations? List and explain three other factors we would have to consider AND discuss three limitations to the model that we devised for calculating the levelized cost of electricity. [6 points]

**ANSWERS**

Utility-scale considerations:
1. Considerations for O+M
2. siting costs and distance to load area
3. cost and complexity of transmission
4. rate negotation
5. 

Limitations:
1. we dont consider rebates other policy incentives that may be provided for an installation that could drive down costs.
2. we dont consider 
3.

## 2 Utility-scale Renewable Energy Technologies [33 points]

In 2015 a bill was passed to increase the California renewable portfolio standard (RPS) to 50.0% by 2030. In 2015, retail sales of electricity totaled 284,005 GWh, 27.6% of which is from renewable energy sources. For details on the state’s RPS, [see here:](​energy.ca.gov/portfolio​). Note that the California RPS mandates the minimum amount of renewable energy to be sold, not a minimum amount of renewable energy capacity installed.

```python
```

### 2a

To begin, let’s try to figure out how much renewables capacity the state RPS might require if load growth from 2015 through 2030 increases at a rate of 0.80%/year. Assume that the average capacity factor for wind is 0.35 and for solar is 0.17, and that half of new renewables GWh come from wind and half come from solar PV. What is the total amount of additional wind and solar energy capacity (in GW) that would need to be installed since 2013 to meet the 50.0% RPS in 2030? [8 points]

```python
ca = {
    'growth_rate':0.80,
    'wind':{
        'cap_fac':0.35,
        'mix': 0.50,
    },
    'solar':{
        'cap_fac':0.17,
        'mix':0.50,
    }
    'E_2015_gwh':284005
}

ca['E_2030_gwh']: 

```

### 2b
How much total land area (km​2​) would be required to satisfy the installed capacity listed below? Calculate area for (i) wind, (ii) solar, and (iii) the total combined. Start with the assumptions given below and state clearly any additional assumptions you make. [14 points; 6 for each estimate, plus 2 pt for the total]

- Wind: Turbine rotor diameters are 80. meters, their hub height is 60. meters, and they are 40.% efficient in converting the kinetic energy of the wind into electricity at 10.0 m/s. The turbines are placed in rows, with a spacing of 5.0-rotor-diameters between turbines within each row and 8.0-rotor diameters between rows. (Assume that all turbines require the same physical footprint – even if they are at the edge of the wind farm.) Assume a turbine’s rating is based on a wind speed of 10.0 m/s, and air density is 1.2 kg/m3. Use the Rayleigh distribution equation where ​p ​is the air density, ​A ​ is the swept area of the wind turbine. 91 .5pAv ,P per turbine = 1 *0 3 (remember that the area of a circle is equal to 𝛑r​2​), ​v ​ is the wind speed, and ​P ​ per turbine ​ is the (nameplate) power output of each turbine in W. ​Also, ignore your results from 3.a and assume that the total installed capacity required for wind is 12 GW.
- Solar PV: Assume average solar insolation is 1.36 kW/m​2​, and that PV panels convert sunlight to electricity with an efficiency of 15%. ​Also, ignore your results from 3.a and assume that the total installed capacity required for solar is 25 GW. 

### 2c

 Access the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) daily renewables [report for June 21, 2015:](http://content.caiso.com/green/renewrpt/20150621_DailyRenewablesWatch.pdf​) and [here](http://content.caiso.com/green/renewrpt/20150621_DailyRenewablesWatch.txt)​

- What percent of energy was supplied by renewable energy on that day (2 s.f.)?
- What percentage was supplied by renewable energy during at 1pm (2 s.f.)?
- How about at 6am (2 s.f.)? [6 points]

### 2d
Besides RPS, a feed-in-tariff (FIT) is also a widely adopted strategy to promote renewable energy. FIT policies had been enacted in over 70 countries by 2012, according to Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century’s Renewables Global Status Report 2013. In one paragraph, describe the features of RPS and FIT policies, and compare the two policies. [5 points]
