## 1 Comparing PV costs across the US [25 points]

### 1a

Let us consider a simple 15 m^2 rooftop installation of crystalline-silicon (c-Si) PV modules. Remember that PV modules are rated to receive 1.0 kW/m^2 ​of solar radiation. Assuming peak solar irradiance of 1.0 kW/m^2, what would the peak output of this system be (in kW) if the modules are 21% efficient? [2 points]

 ```python
def oneA():
    roof = {'area_m2':15}
    eff = 0.21
    irradiance_w_m2 = 1.0
    roof['peak_kw'] = roof['area_m2'] * eff
    print('Peak kW: ', format(roof['peak_kw'],'.1e'))
    return roof

oneA()
 ```

**ANSWERS:** Peak kW: 3.2

### 1b

Compute the annualized cost for this type of PV module (in $/year) using the values below from the SunShot Vision Study (2011), assuming for simplicity that operating costs can be ignored. Assume a 5.0% discount rate and 25-year lifetime. [3 points]

|------------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Module cost                  | $/Watt_peak | 0.54         |
| Permitting & Inspection cost | $/Watt_peak | 0.84         |
| Installation labor cost      | $/Watt_peak | 1.00         |
| Inverter Cost                | $/Watt_peak | 0.12         |

```python
def oneB(roof):
    #costs in $/Watt_peak
    costs = {
        'items': {

            }
    #add up all the costs
    for item, price in costs['items'].items():
        costs['total'] += price
    # find the annualized cost per W_peak using n = 25 and r = 0.05
    def U_series(P, n, r):
        n = n
        discount_r = r
        U = P * ( discount_r / ( 1 - ( 1 + discount_r)**-n) )
        return U
    #store and print answer, with sigfigs
    P = costs['total'] * (roof['peak_kw'] * 1000)
    costs['ann_cost'] = U_series(P, 25, 0.05)
    return print('annualized cost: ', format(costs['ann_cost'],'.1e'), ' $ / yr')

### 1f

How might our results for the levelized cost of PV electricity differ if we were considering utility-scale installations instead of residential-scale rooftop installations? List and explain three other factors we would have to consider AND discuss three limitations to the model that we devised for calculating the levelized cost of electricity. [6 points]

**ANSWERS**

Utility-scale considerations:

1. Considerations for O+M
2. siting costs and distance to load area
3. cost and complexity of transmission
4. rate negotation

Limitations:

1. we dont consider rebates other policy incentives that may be provided for an installation that could drive down costs.
2. we dont use observed capacity factors for installed systems
3. doesnt consider net metering, in the case of residential

## 2 Utility-scale Renewable Energy Technologies [33 points]

In 2015 a bill was passed to increase the California renewable portfolio standard (RPS) to 50.0% by 2030. In 2015, retail sales of electricity totaled 284,005 GWh, 27.6% of which is from renewable energy sources. For details on the state’s RPS, [see here:](​energy.ca.gov/portfolio​). Note that the California RPS mandates the minimum amount of renewable energy to be sold, not a minimum amount of renewable energy capacity installed.

### 2a

To begin, let’s try to figure out how much renewables capacity the state RPS might require if load growth from 2015 through 2030 increases at a rate of 0.80%/year. Assume that the average capacity factor for wind is 0.35 and for solar is 0.17, and that half of new renewables GWh come from wind and half come from solar PV. What is the total amount of additional wind and solar energy capacity (in GW) that would need to be installed since 2015 to meet the 50.0% RPS in 2030? [8 points]

```python
ca = {
    'growth_rate':0.0080,
    'wind':{
        'cap_fac':0.35,
        'mix': 0.50,
    },
    'solar':{
        'cap_fac':0.17,
        'mix':0.50,
    },
    'E_2015_gwh':284005
}

ca['E_2015_renewables_gwh'] = ca['E_2015_gwh'] * 0.276
# growth: size_time = size_0 * (1 + rate)^time
ca['E_2030_gwh'] = ca['E_2015_gwh'] * (1 + ca['growth_rate'])**15
# find amount of renewables req. in 2030
ca['E_2030_growth_gwh'] = (ca['E_2030_gwh'] * 0.5) - ca['E_2015_renewable_gwh']

# find growth of each
ca['wind']['growth'] = (ca['E_2030_growth_gwh'] * 0.5) / (ca['wind']['cap_fac'] * 8760)
ca['solar']['growth'] = (ca['E_2030_growth_gwh'] * 0.5) / (ca['solar']['cap_fac'] * 8760)

```

**ANSWERS:**

- solar: 27.4 gW
- wind: 13.3 gW
- Total: 40 gW
### 2b

How much total land area (km​2​) would be required to satisfy the installed capacity listed below? Calculate area for (i) wind, (ii) solar, and (iii) the total combined. Start with the assumptions given below and state clearly any additional assumptions you make. [14 points; 6 for each estimate, plus 2 pt for the total]

- Wind: Turbine rotor diameters are 80. meters, their hub height is 60. meters, and they are 40.% efficient in converting the kinetic energy of the wind into electricity at 10.0 m/s. The turbines are placed in rows, with a spacing of 5.0-rotor-diameters between turbines within each row and 8.0-rotor diameters between rows. (Assume that all turbines require the same physical footprint – even if they are at the edge of the wind farm.) Assume a turbine’s rating is based on a wind speed of 10.0 m/s, and air density is 1.2 kg/m3. Use the Rayleigh distribution equation (`P_wind_per_turbine = 1.91 * 0.5pAv^3`) where ​`p` is the air density, ​`A`​ is the swept area of the wind. (remember that the area of a circle is equal to `𝛑r^​2`​), ​`v` ​ is the wind speed, ​and `P_wind_per_turbine` is the total potential power in the air for one turbine in W.  ​Also, ignore your results from ​​2.a​​ and assume that the total installed capacity required for wind is 12 GW.

- Solar PV: Assume average solar insolation is 1.36 kW/m​2​, and that PV panels convert sunlight to electricity with an efficiency of 15%. ​Also, ignore your results from 2.a and assume that the total installed capacity required for solar is 25 GW.

```python
import math
wind = {
    'rotor_m': 80,
    'hub_height_m': 60,
    'eff': 0.40,
    'speed_ms': 10.0,

}
km_m = 1 / 1000
#find the area req for each turbine
wind['turbine_space_m2'] = wind['rotor_m'] * 5.0
wind['row_space_m2'] = wind['rotor_m'] * 8.0
wind['req_area_m2_turbine'] = wind['turbine_space_m2'] * wind['row_space_m2']
#find  Rayleigh distribution
wind['P_potential_W'] = 1.91 * 0.5 * wind['air_kg_m3'] * (math.pi * (wind['rotor_m'] / 2)**2) * (wind['speed_ms']**3)
# find power per m2 and use it to fine total area required.
wind['P_m2_W'] = wind['req_area_m2_turbine'] / (wind['P_potential_W'] / wind['eff'])
wind['total_area_km2'] =  ( wind['installed_cap_gw'] * 1e9 ) * (wind['P_m2_W']) * km_m

solar = {
    'irradiance_kw_m2':1.36,
    'eff':0.15,
    'installed_cap_gw':25
}
m_km = 1000
solar['req_area'] =  (solar['installed_cap_gw'] * 1e6)  * (1 / (solar['irradiance_kw_m2'] * solar['eff']) ) * 1000

### 2d

Besides RPS, a feed-in-tariff (FIT) is also a widely adopted strategy to promote renewable energy. FIT policies had been enacted in over 70 countries by 2012, according to Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century’s Renewables Global Status Report 2013. In one paragraph, describe the features of RPS and FIT policies, and compare the two policies. [5 points]



## 3 Nuclear Energy and Waste [ER100/PP184: 23 POINTS; ER200/PP284: 28 points]

After the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) closed in 2012, The Diablo Canyon Power Plant is the last remaining nuclear power plant operating in California. Located near San Luis Obispo, the Diablo Canyon facility is operated by PG&E and is composed of two pressurized-water nuclear reactors. Each reactor can produce electricity at a rate of 1,100 MW and the plant typically operates at an average capacity factor of 91 %. Nuclear power plants such as Diablo Canyon are important sources of baseload electricity because of their high output capability and low variable operating costs. In June 2016 due to a number of factors (including proximity to earthquake fault lines), PG&E announced that it plans to close Diablo Canyon when the current operating license expires in 2025.

### 3c

Assuming electricity generation in 2012 remained the same as 2011, and all of the lost capacity from shutting down SONGS was made up by increased output from California’s natural gas-fired power plants, how much additional CO​2​ was released in 2012?  You can assume that SONGS did not contribute to 2012 generation, SONGS’ electricity generation emitted no CO​2​, Diablo Canyon generated as much electricity in 2012 as it did in 2016, and California natural gas-fired power plants emit 388 lbs of CO​2​ ​per MWh. (5 points)

### 3d

Diablo Canyon stores 95% of its spent nuclear fuel onsite. In what year will the Plutonium-240 (Pu-240) generated by Diablo Canyon in the year ​2016​ have decayed to one-third of its ​2016 quantity? How much will that quantity stored on site be in tonnes? (6 points)

To solve, make the following assumptions:

- In a light water reactor, approximately 1.0kg of spent nuclear fuel is produced for every 50. megawatt- days (MWd)​ of thermal energy input.
- For the purposes of this analysis, assume the spent nuclear fuel produced is 1.6% of Pu-240 by mass. Pu-240 has a half-life of 6,560 years.
- The thermal efficiency of the power plant is 33%
- Use equation for radioactive decay: Q(t) = Q​_0*e​^-kt​ where:
  - Q(t) = quantity of radioactive material at time t (or fraction of the original quantity)
  - Q_​0 ​= original quantity of radioactive material
  - k = the decay constant
  - t = time interval in years

```python
diablo = {
    'mw': 18000,
    'eff':0.30,
    'waste_kg_mwd':1.0 / 50
}
pu240 = {

diablo['waste'] = (diablo['mw'] / diablo['eff']) * mwh_gwh * diablo['waste_kg_mwd'] * day_hr * pu240['percent']

qt = 1/3

# solve for Q(t) = Q_0e^-kt
# ln(1/3) = -kt
#sqrt(1/2) = ln(2) / k
#k = ln(2)  6560 
#t = ln(1/3) / -0.00010566

diablo['future_waste'] = diablo['waste'] * .33

In this question, we will review some of the information on toxics releases that is available to the public. Go to the EPA’s [Toxics Release Inventory website](​http://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program​) and use the “Get TRI Information” tool or this [link](​http://iaspub.epa.gov/triexplorer/tri_release.chemical​) to answer the following questions.

### 4a

(i) Who were the three heaviest toxic polluters in Los Angeles County in 2017? (ii) What industries do those top three polluters represent? (iii) How many of the top 10 polluters are directly related to energy production or refining? Make a list. Hint: Click on the “Facility” tab on the top of the TRI Explorer page, and complete the relevant information. After you generate the report, sort the list of companies by “Total On-Site and Off-Site Disposal or Other Releases” by clicking on the appropriate triangle. [4 points]  

### 4b

Examine the data provided for the top polluter, and perhaps visit their website, to get more information about them: (i) In a sentence, what does this company do and how does it relate to energy production? (ii) ii. What is this company’s top release? Click on that chemical release link and find out where the pollutant is emitted or disposed of. [4 points]  

### 4c

Now, re-order the facilities by total on-site disposal and examine the facility with the highest amount. (i) Describe this company’s total on- and off-site releases since 1990. (You can answer this question in words.) (ii) Describe any changes from 2016 to 2017. To answer this question, click on the company name and scroll down to “TRI Facility Trend Graphs” and click on the “On- and Off-site Releases.” [4 points]  

### 4d

Find a recent news article (2016 or 2017) online that discusses environmental justice issues related to an energy facility or project that is existing or proposed. (i) Write a two sentence summary of the issue (plus, include the URL of the article). (ii) For each of Pastor’s (2007) three EJ questions below (see pp. 351-2,lecture slides, and Week 11 section handout), write a specific question to consider related to the issue in the article. You will have 3 specific questions in the end. [Example article:](http://grist.org/climate-energy/proposed-natural-gas-pipeline-raises-major-social-justice-concerns/​) [5 points]

- Q1: Is the pattern of inequity simply a manifestation of market outcomes rather than class or racial discrimination?
- Q2: Is the pattern a result of moves to higher-risk areas driven by choice rather than dictate?
- Q3: Are there real and consequential effects in terms of wealth and health?

## 5  Policy Memo (continued) [10 points]

Continuing from our last problem set, develop two pieces of evidence you could use to support the policy recommendation you’ll be making in your memo. (Your topic for this exercise need not be the same as you gave in your memo “bumper sticker” on Problem Set 5.) Your evidence might consist of publicly available data, a graph, a chart, or your own calculation. For instance, if you were advocating incentives for increasing distributed combined heat and power in California, find out/calculate how much energy is currently used for heating commercial buildings in a major city like San Francisco. With each piece of evidence, provide a 1-2 sentence description of how the information could be used to make your case. Be sure to include citations for your evidence.
