## 1
*1. Combustion  Drax Power Station, a power plant in the United Kingdom that supplies about 7% of the nation’s electricity and has historically burned coal for electricity, embarked on a decarbonization plan in 2014 to transition to burning wood biomass instead of coal. In this question we will examine the energy and carbon emissions from generating electricity using wood as opposed to coal. Assume the energy density for coal and wood to be 29.3 MJ/kg and 15.0 MJ/kg, respectively. [30 points total for ER100/PP184; 35 points total for ER200/PP284]*
### 1a
*Based on an approximate formula for coal (C​15​H​11​O), and an approximate formula for wood pellets (C​6​H​10​O​5​), write the balanced combustion equation for each fuel. Assume complete combustion in oxygen. What are the CO​2​ emission factors for coal and wood in kg CO​2​/GJ? [8 points]*

**Balance the equations:**
$$1C_{6}H_{10}~O + 5O_{2}~ -> 6H_{2}O + 5CO_{2}$$
$$2C_{15}H_{11}~O + 34.5O_{2}~ -> 30H_{2}O + 11CO_{2}$$

```python
### 1C6_H10_O5 + 5 O2 -> 6 CO2 + 5 H2O
### 2C15_H11_0 + 34.5 O2 -> 30 CO2 + 11 H20
drax = {}
C = {'mass': 12} 
O = {'mass': 16}
H = {'mass': 1}

coal = {'mj/kg':29.3}
coal['mass'] = (C['mass'] * 15 ) + (H['mass'] * 11) + (O['mass'] * 1)
wood = {'mj/kg': 15.0}
wood['mass'] = (C['mass'] * 6) + (H['mass'] * 10) + (O['mass'] * 5)
co2 = {'mass': 44}

```

**coal:** $$\frac{1mol coal}{207g coal} * \frac{30 co2}{2 mol coal} * \frac{44g co2}{1 mol co2} * \frac{1 kg}{1000 g} * \frac{1000 g}{1 kg}$$

**wood:**
$$\frac{1molwood}{162 wood} * \frac{30 co2}{2 mol coal} * \frac{44g co2}{1 mol co2} * \frac{1 kg}{1000 g} * \frac{1000 g}{1 kg}$$

```python
###( 1 mol coal / 207g coal) * (30 co2 / 2 mol coal) * (44g co2 / 1 mol co2) * (1 kg / 1000 g ) * (1000 g / 1 kg)
coal['kg_co2/kg_coal'] = ( 1 / coal['mass']) * ( 30 / 2 ) * (co2['mass'] / 1 ) * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 1000)
coal['kg_co2/gj_t'] = coal['kg_co2/kg_coal'] * ( 1 / coal['mj/kg']) * (1000 / 1 )

###( 1 mol woood / 162g wood) * (30 co2 / 2 mol coal) * (44g co2 / 1 mol co2) * (1 kg / 1000 g ) * (1000 g / 1 kg)
wood['kg_co2/kg_wood'] = ( 1 / wood['mass']) * ( 30 / 2) * (co2['mass'] / 1 ) * ( 1000 / 1 ) * (1 / 1000)
wood['kg_co2/gj_t'] = wood['kg_co2/kg_wood'] * ( 1 / wood['mj/kg'] )  * (1000 / 1 )

print(coal['kg_co2/gj_t'])
print(wood['kg_co2/gj_t'])


```
**ANSWERS:** 109 kg CO2 / 1 GJ coal, 4 kg CO2 / 1 GJ wood 

### 1b
*Assume the efficiency of a coal power plant is 37% and that of a biomass plant is 33%. What is the mass of carbon dioxide (in kg) released per kWh of electricity generated from each plant? Based on your answer, will Drax Power’s decarbonization plan be effective? What is one factor that’s missing from this analysis? [8 points]*
```python
drax['coal_eff'] = 0.37 
drax['biomass_eff'] = 0.33
gj_kwh = 1 / 277.7

coal['kg_co2/kwh_e'] = (coal['kg_co2/gj_t'] / drax['coal_eff'] ) * gj_kwh
wood['kg_co2/kwh_e'] = (wood['kg_co2/gj_t'] / drax['biomass_eff'] ) * gj_kwh

print(coal['kg_co2/kwh_e'])
print(wood['kg_co2/kwh_e'])
 
```
**ANSWERS:** 1.1 kg co2/kwh_e coal, 3 kg co2 / kwh_e wood. 

Based on this data alone, it will not be. However this does not account for the source of the carbon. While the total emissions is higher for biomass, it is using co2 that is already in the modern carbon cycle. The coal is introducing 'stored' carbon that has not been present in the modern carbon cycle. Of course, depending on how the biomass is sourced, it could have a significant impact on forest sequestration.

### 1c
*Before Drax Power Station began their transition to biomass usage, the power plant used about 9.1 million metric tonnes of coal in an average year. The power plant’s rated capacity is 4.0 x 10​3​ MW. Assuming the power plant has an efficiency of 37%, and the energy density for coal is 29.3 MJ/kg, what was the capacity factor of Drax Power Station in an average year before 2014? [5 points]*
```python
##1c
drax['coal_tonnes_y'] = 9.1e6
drax['nameplate_mw'] = 4.0e3
kg_tonnes = 1000 / 1
kwh_mj = 1 / 3.6
kwh_mwh = 1000 / 1 
drax['coal_kwh_y_e'] = drax['coal_tonnes_y'] * kg_tonnes * coal['mj/kg'] * kwh_mj * drax['coal_eff']
drax['coal_cap_factor'] = (drax['coal_kwh_y_e'] / kwh_mwh) / (drax['nameplate_mw'] * 8760 )

```
**ANSWERS:** capacity factor before 2014: 0.78

### 1d
*When Drax Power Station converts fully to biomass-fired electricity, Drax Power projects that they will use about 13.8 million metric tonnes of biomass yearly. Drax Power wants to output the same amount of energy using only biomass as they did using coal by adding an additional unit with a capacity factor of 80.% that burns additional biomass (beyond the projected 13.8 million metric tonnes). What does the nameplate capacity of the additional unit have to be in MW in order for Drax Power to achieve the same energy output with biomass as they did with coal? Assume the biomass-fired power plant has an efficiency of 33%, and that biomass has an energy density of 15.0 MJ/kg.  [9 points]*
```python
##1d
drax['biomass_tonnes_y'] = 13.8e6
drax['new_unit'] = {'cap_factor': 80.0}
drax['biomass_kwh_y_e'] =  drax['biomass_tonnes_y'] * kg_tonnes * wood['mj/kg'] * kwh_mj * drax['biomass_eff']

drax['new_unit']['nameplate_mw'] = ( drax['coal_kwh_y_e'] - drax['biomass_kwh_y_e'] ) * (1 / 8760 ) * (1 / kwh_mwh) / 0.80 
print(drax['new_unit']['nameplate_mw'])

```
**ANSWERS:** 1200 MW
### 1e
*8ER200/PP284 only ​UC Berkeley owns a gas combined heat and power plant (CHP), which can produce 16GJ of heat per hour for steam generation and 25MW of electricity at the same time. The sales engineer claimed that the Total System Efficiency can be 75-80%, which agreed with the EPA’s description ​https://www.epa.gov/chp/methods-calculating-chp-efficiency . But some are skeptical about this efficiency rating. Read the definition of Total System Efficiency (TSE) and Effective Electric Efficiency (EEE) on the above website. What are the TSE and EEE with the following operational data? Assume that natural gas has an energy content of 50.0 MJ/kg* [5 points] 
- *Boiler efficiency: 0.80 - Fuel input: 2.8 tons of natural gas per hour*

**ANSWERS:** TSE 0.86, EEE 0.74 

## 2
*Forty years ago Amory Lovins wrote his seminal piece describing “hard” and “soft” energy paths. In this question, we would like you to consider Lovins’s arguments in the context of important energy issues today, as well as compare the Lovins paper with some of the articles you’ve read concerning energy and development*

### 2a
*Describe Lovins’s distinction between hard and soft paths in a few sentences using your own language*

**ANSWERS:** The hard path is one that relies on a highly centralized power production system that focuses only on the supply side, always increasing capacity to meet rising demand. It focuses on relatively few means of generation, such as large centralized coal/nuclear/gas plants. It is not flexible to changes in demand or fuel supply, and is very capital intensive. The soft path, on the other hand, is much more flexible. On the supply side, it  relies on "renewable" sources of energy, such as solar, wind, etc, with a larger diversification of both types of generation and decenteralization of generation. On the demand side, it focuses on increases in efficency, looking for ways to decrease the load, and ues waste energy when appropriate. 

### 2b
*Pick a recent article from a reliable news source (use your judgement) that addresses a contemporary energy issue, and, in a short paragraph, comment on whether you think the issues is in the hard or soft path approach. Please start by including a citation for your article and a sentence summarizing its main point*

**ANSWERS:** *Mapping what it would take for a renaissance for nuclear energy, Geuss, 2018 (https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/mapping-what-it-would-take-for-a-renaissance-for-nuclear-energy/)*
Summary: MIT argues that traditional nuclear is only viable if C02 Emissions are capped significantly.

The development of Nuclear Energy, as it has been practiced in the US since the birth of the nuclear age, has been the very definition of the "hard" path. Most reactors are highly customized, one-off designs that require years, if not decades of construction, federal loan guarantees, and specialized support from government and utilities. Existing reactors outside of military or research use, produce massive amounts of power that are highly centralized. Huge construction and operation costs of these types of plants have made reactors un-economical, and Geuss summarizes a report by MIT that argues that these "hard" path reactors may only become viable again if "the allowable carbon emissions rate is reduced to less than 50 gCO2/kWh".

### 2c
*Hard and soft are relative terms, and the same energy technology can be applied in ways that are consistent with either the hard or soft approach. Take the energy issue you worked with in part b and describe, in a sentence or two, how the issue might be affected by a softer approach (if you identified it as a hard path approach), or a harder approach (if you identified it as a soft path approach) than what was discussed in the article you read*

**ANSWERS:** A softer approach to helping facilitate a renaissance in nuclear energy would be instead of promoting large scale nuclear plants with existing designs, would instead be to promote small, modular reactors that could factory built, deployed more rapidly and more widely. Ideally they would be more modern designs that would use 'safe' fuels like thorium, or use existing nuclear waste as its feedstock. 

### 2d
*List the five fallacies in the “Mundane Science” article by Kammen and Dove, and discuss any connection between the points raised by Lovins and the five fallacies.*

**ANSWERS:** 
1. Emphasis on mudane science amounts to a rejection of scientific and technological progress. 
2. assumes that science is a zero-sum game where investment in anything besides basic research reduces the chance of breakthrough discovery.
3. A perceived tension between basic and applied research.
4. development outcomes are essentially technological rather than sociological in nature.
5. mundane aspects of development have more to do with society than science.

Perhaps the strongest link between the attitude listed in the above fallacies and Lovins description of the hard and soft paths is the following: that the hard path and the fallacies put an emphasis on the rigidity of humans and human behavior. Individual demand cannot and should not change, basic science can overcome human behavior with new technologies instead of optimizing those we already have. As alluded to, the soft path and Mundane Science do not reject basic science or "high" technology advancements, but ask that we also work with what we have, and think more systematically.

### 2e
*The Lovins piece is focused on energy in the context of the United States. How applicable do you believe the concepts and arguments he uses are to energy-impoverished, developing countries (as in, those countries with average annual per capita energy consumption rates under 1 TOE)*

**ANSWERS:** As the decades following his publication have shown, energy-impoverished nations have struggled to set up the highly centralized and capital intensive energy networks that are promoted in the "hard" path.  Lovins suggestion of a "soft" path can provide alternatives for providing individuals with more energy that they otherwise may never receive. We've seen this with the use of solar PV, solar thermal, and other technologies that can give many of the same benefits that could come from a centralized grid without the capital investments required.

### 3a
*Drawing on lectures and the readings, explain why in many parts of the developing world, solid fuels are the predominant source of energy use. What are the three known toxic pollutants that are products of incomplete combustion? What are three negative health impacts associated with household combustion of solid fuels? Elaborate on why, on average globally, women are at higher risk of these negative health impacts? [9 points]*

**ANSWERS:** 
In much of the developing world, there is little to no access to infrastructure for grid-tied electrity or gas, for example. As such, most people rely on gathering their own energy from the environment around them, in the form of wood, dung, or other biomass. If they do not gather their own energy, the next most likely fuel would be coal, which has high energy density and can be transported easily. Burned over open fires or in unsophisticated stoves, these fuels often burn very inefficently, releasing various ammounts of NOx, SOx, Particulate Matter (PM10 - 2.5) and the precursors to Ozone (O3). Since these are often burned indoors in these inefficent stoves or open fires, where ventillation is poor, home occupants can suffer from various respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and asthema, as well as heart disease, lung cancer, etc. Women, overwhelmingly tend to do the cooking work, and as such spend much more time in polluted indoor enviroments, which leads to higher risk of impact. 
### 3b
*ER 200/PP 284 only - ​ Referring to the report by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, list and briefly explain one risk unrelated to air pollution faced by women who rely on solid fuels for energy. [2 points]*

**ANSWERS:** Women face increased risk of sexual violence by a non-partner. They are often the primary firewood collectors, and spend many hours per day out of the home searching for said firewood, which exposes them to this risk. 

### 3c
*From the Goldemberg reading, select one of the graphs from Figure 3.5 life expectancy, infant mortality, illiteracy, or total fertility rate and discuss the relationship of the variable in question to commercial energy consumption per capita. Why does the curve flatten out? [10 points]*

**ANSWERS:** Life Expectancy / TOE per captia per year: The relationship between life expectency and energy use per captia is somewhat unsurprising. Increasing access to energy likely has strong correlation to access better transit, in turn opening access to, obstensibly, better healthcare (also driven by better energy acccess), and dietary options. This pays high dividends, until access things like high quality healthcare and food are well dispersed. Eventually additional energy consumption is not accounted for in "essential" for meeting one's needs, those having been met. Instead, it is driven into increasingly intensive leisure, such as travel, consumerism, and various luxuries that have little or even negative impact on lifespan.  

### 3d
*Refer to the reading Alstone, Gershenson, Kammen (2015). What major trends have caused a recent increase in off-grid electricity access and off-grid electricity quality? [6 points]*

**ANSWERS:** The most important trends leading to improvements in access and quality are the rise of super-efficent products such as LED lights, smart phones, televisions, etc, paired with massive reduction in PV prices. This has allowed pico sized, home, and micro grid deployments expand rapidly where previously the barrier to entry was too high for poor communities. This has been augmented by improvements in telecommunication and sensing tech that permits better management of off-grid systems as well as facilitating access to credit and payment systems that previously would have been unmanagable.      

## 4
*The OECD (or, broadly speaking, developed) nations’ energy consumption and CO​2​ emissions have stabilized in recent years, while those for non-OECD (or, broadly speaking, developing) nations have been steadily growing. This is of major concern in the context of global coordination in mitigating climate change. BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries are some of the largest economies in the non-OECD category. The following is a table taken from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2018. ​[20 points]*

### 4a
*The BP Statistical Review of World Energy refers to primary energy consumption as reported in Table 1. In a sentence, what does primary energy consumption mean? Please cite any sources that you use to define the term. [2 points]*

**ANSWERS:** Primary Energy Consumption is the consumption of the "raw" source fuel for combustion or non-combustion uses, ie. coal combusted (primary) to create electricity (secondary) *EIA.gov https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php*

### 4b
*For the countries shown in the data above, there is typically a positive correlation between energy use and CO​2​ emissions. Are there any countries that do not demonstrate this trend? Referring to the IPAT equation, list a possible reason why some countries may not have a positive relationship between energy use and CO​2​ emissions. [2 points]*

In this dataset, russia has an increase in energy use with a slight decrease in C02 emmissions. I would presume that in the last 10 years Affluence and Population have not increased rapidly or even decreased slightly, while technological improvements in effiency to the russian grid have probably increased. Things like old soviet era coal assets being retired and replaced with more modern natural gas plants, for example, may account for this. 

### 4c
*The exponential growth model is used when a quantity increases or decreases at a rate that is proportional to its original size in each time period. Exponential growth is represented by the formula XXX The exponential growth formula can be rearranged to solve for the growth rate ​r, using the formula ​r = ln(Qn/Q0)/n. Referring to this formula, find the rate of growth ​r​ for primary energy use in each country (as an annual percentage, up to 3 significant figures) between 2007 and 2017. Show your work.
