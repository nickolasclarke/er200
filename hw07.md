## 1 Wind Power Analysis [10 points undergrad, 15 points grad]

In this problem, you will perform a few calculations that will help you understand and evaluate the  performance of a small wind farm in Texas. Here is a wind speed frequency distribution 80. m above  ground-level for an average day on our wind farm. Assume the density of air is 1.225 kg/m​3​ at 15​o​C and 1.0  atm.
  
| Wind speed class (m/s) | Frequency (%) | Cumulative Frequency (%) |
|------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 0.0-2.9                | 10.           | 10                       |
| 3.0-5.9                | 30.           | 40                       |
| 6.0-9.9                | 40.           | 80                       |
| 10.0-13.9              | 15            | 95                       |

### 1a

- (i) Calculate the total energy in the wind per square meter of swept area over 24 hours (kWh/m​2​).
- (ii) Calculate the average power in the wind per square meter of swept area over 24 hours (kW/m​2​). Use the middle value of each wind speed class to determine the power in the wind of that class (e.g. with  a speed class of 5.0 - 7.0 m/s you would use 6.0 m/s). (Note: Assume no need for a correction factor due  to a Rayleigh distribution.) [6 points]

## 2​ Batteries and Energy Storage [12 points undergrad, 16 points grad]

A battery is a device that stores chemical energy and converts it to electrical energy. Rechargeable batteries are also capable of doing the reverse (converting electrical energy into chemical energy and storing it). Batteries  play a key role in many proposed decarbonization pathways, both in the transportation and electric power sectors. In this question we will review the battery basics and quantify some aspects of lithium ion battery  technology.

### 2a

Let’s assume that a first generation Tesla Powerwall is made up of battery cells that use graphite (C6)  in the anode and lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO​2​) in the cathode. Assume each cell’s capacity is 2.5Ah  and has a voltage of 3.7 V. If the Powerwall’s total storage capacity is 6.4 kWh, how many cells are  there? What is the total mass of anode (kg) and cathode (kg) material in the Powerwall? Hint: In  lecture, we described a calculation to find capacity of Li in graphite (370 mAh/g) and Li in LiCoO​2​ is  (137 mAh/g). [6 points]

```python

```

**ANSWERS:**

### 2b

How many lithium ions are in the Powerwall? What is the mass of lithium per Powerwall (in g)?  Assume 1.0 lithium ion per unit charge (i.e. 100.% of lithium atoms go through the oxidation  reduction reaction) and the molar mass of lithium is 6.94 g/mol. Also recall that one unit charge is  1.6x10​-19​ coulombs, and a coulomb is one Ampere-second. [4 points]

```python

```

**ANSWERS:**

### 2c

Total lithium deposits in the world are estimated at 20 x 10​9​ kg. One critique about Li-ion battery  technology is the amount of the lithium resource (it is estimated that all the lithium in the world  could only electrify 62% of the world’s vehicle fleet). If 500 million homes were to install a  first-generation Powerwall, what percentage of the world’s lithium resources would be used up? [2  points]

```python

```

**ANSWERS:**

### 2d GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY [part d] (PP284/ER200)

Review the following discharge curves for a lithium coin battery (the type commonly found in  watches). The battery has a rated capacity of 240 mAh and a voltage cutoff of 1.6 V (below which the  voltage is too low to power the electronics in the device). Estimate the difference in energy delivered  when the rate of discharge is 3.0 mA vs. 0.5mA. (Your estimates can be very rough, so long as they  are grounded in the basic characteristics of the discharge curves --1 s.f.). What explains the  difference? [4 points]

## 3 Biomass Energy & Transportation [18 points]

Biomass can be used to create ethanol fuel. It can also be used to generate electricity, that can then be used to  charge electric vehicles (EVs). In this problem, you will determine whether ethanol or electricity can provide a  higher biomass-to-wheel efficiency. Assume that one hectare of cropland can produce 14 tons of dry  switchgrass per year and that dry switchgrass has an energy density of 15 MJ/kg.

### 3a

Each ton of dry switchgrass can be processed to produce 73 gallons of ethanol. Ethanol has an  energy density of 92 MJ/gallon. Assume that the internal combustion engine (ICE) is 23% efficient  in converting fuel energy to useful work at the wheels (motion). With what efficiency is biomass  energy delivered to the wheels in this ICE car? (4 points)

```python

```

**ANSWERS:**

### 3b

Alternatively, each ton of dry switchgrass could be used directly to generate electricity, and this  electricity could in turn be used to operate an EV. Assume that a biomass-fueled power plant has a  first-law efficiency of 37%. There is a 8.0% loss for transmission and distribution of electricity from  the power plant to the car charging station. The motor plus battery is 85% efficient in converting  electrical energy delivered from the charging station to mechanical work. With what efficiency is  biomass energy delivered to the wheels in this ICE car? (4 points)

```python

```

**ANSWERS:**

### 3c

According to the above analysis regarding these two uses of biomass for transportation, if we are  concerned about utilizing biomass resources most energy efficiently, should we use biomass to  generate electricity or should we use it to produce liquid fuels? Many factors are left out in this  analysis. Using what you’re learned throughout this class, mention and briefly explain two  shortcomings of this simplified analysis. (5 points)

```python

```

**ANSWERS:**

### 3d

Let’s assume switchgrass is used to produce ethanol for use in 100% ethanol-fueled vehicles. How  much land (in km​2​) would be required for switchgrass production to provide enough ethanol to meet  the fuel demand of all cars the United States? (Assume 264 million cars traveling an average of 13,000  mi/yr with an average fuel economy of 24 miles/gallon ethanol.) Roughly which US state is this [land area comparable to](​https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_area​) (5 points)

## 4 Climate Change & Earth’s Energy Budget [13 points undergrad, 19 points grad]

Read through this summary report from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2013 from this [week’s readings:](​https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf) In section C - “Drivers of Climate Change” there is a chart listing major drivers of changes in radiative  forcing (W/m2) of Earth’s energy budget.  Radiative forcing (RF) measures the difference between sunlight  absorbed by the earth and energy radiated back to space, quantifying the change in energy fluxes (in Watts per  m2 of Earth’s surface) caused by these atmospheric drivers relative to the year 1750 (pre-industrial period).  Positive RF leads to surface warming, negative RF leads to surface cooling.

### 4a

According to the above chart, which compounds from anthropogenic activities have resulted in positive  radiative forcing since 1750 (i.e. have had a greenhouse effect and contributed to surface warming)?  List at  least 3. [3 points]

Discuss at least two compounds and links to these human activities. [3 points]

**ANSWERS:**
1.
2.
  
### 4c

Former ERG PhD student Chris Jones has created a tool for individuals to estimate all direct and  indirect emissions of GHGs in CO​2​-equivalent units resulting from their choices regarding  transportation, food, housing (including energy use), and goods and services consumption. Go to  [Chris’s website](​https://coolcalifornia.arb.ca.gov/calculator-households-individuals​) and use the  calculator to answer the following questions regarding your carbon footprint.  You can choose to  provide values for just yourself or for your whole household, either one is acceptable. (Please be as  honest and accurate as possible with the calculator inputs you provide. The information will be kept  confidential.)
