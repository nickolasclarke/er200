## 1 Wind Power Analysis [10 points undergrad, 15 points grad]

In this problem, you will perform a few calculations that will help you understand and evaluate the performance of a small wind farm in Texas. Here is a wind speed frequency distribution 80. m above  ground-level for an average day on our wind farm. Assume the density of air is 1.225 kg/m​3​ at 15​o​C and 1.0 atm.
  
| Wind speed class (m/s) | Frequency (%) | Cumulative Frequency (%) |
|------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 0.0-2.9                | 10.           | 10                       |
| 3.0-5.9                | 30.           | 40                       |
| 6.0-9.9                | 40.           | 80                       |
| 10.0-13.9              | 15            | 95                       |
| 14.0-18.0              | 5.0           | 100                      |
  
### 1a

- (i) Calculate the total energy in the wind per square meter of swept area over 24 hours (kWh/m​2​).
- (ii) Calculate the average power in the wind per square meter of swept area over 24 hours (kW/m​2​). Use the middle value of each wind speed class to determine the power in the wind of that class (e.g. with  a speed class of 5.0 - 7.0 m/s you would use 6.0 m/s). (Note: Assume no need for a correction factor due to a Rayleigh distribution.) [6 points]

## 2​ Batteries and Energy Storage [12 points undergrad, 16 points grad]

A battery is a device that stores chemical energy and converts it to electrical energy. Rechargeable batteries are also capable of doing the reverse (converting electrical energy into chemical energy and storing it). Batteries play a key role in many proposed decarbonization pathways, both in the transportation and electric power sectors. In this question we will review the battery basics and quantify some aspects of lithium ion battery technology.

### 2a

Let’s assume that a first generation Tesla Powerwall is made up of battery cells that use graphite (C6)  in the anode and lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO​2​) in the cathode. Assume each cell’s capacity is 2.5Ah  and has a voltage of 3.7 V. If the Powerwall’s total storage capacity is 6.4 kWh, how many cells are  there? What is the total mass of anode (kg) and cathode (kg) material in the Powerwall? Hint: In  lecture, we described a calculation to find capacity of Li in graphite (370 mAh/g) and Li in LiCoO​2​ is  (137 mAh/g). [6 points]

```python
cell = {
    'ah': 2.5,
    'v': 3.7
    }

c6_ah_g = 370
liCoO2_ah_g = 137

#find the watt-hours, using the P = a * v, accounting for time rate present in amp-hours.
cell['wh'] = cell['ah'] * cell['v']
#find number of cells 6.4kwh * 1000 to get to watt-hours, / single cell watt-hour
powerwall_cell = (6.4 * 1e3) / cell['wh']


#find the mass of each part: cell amp-hours * num cells * amp-hour of anode|cathode / gram
cell['anode_g'] = (cell['ah'] * powerwall_cell )/ c6_ah_g
cell['cathode_g'] = (cell['ah'] * powerwall_cell )/ liCoO2_ah_g

print('# of cells:', format(powerwall_cell, '.2g'))
print('anode:' + format(cell['anode_g'], '.2g'), 'kg',
    '\ncathode:' + format(cell['cathode_g'], '.2g'), 'kg')
```

**ANSWERS:**

- \# of cells: 6.9e+02
- anode:4.7 kg
- cathode:13 kg

### 2b

How many lithium ions are in the Powerwall? What is the mass of lithium per Powerwall (in g)?  Assume 1.0 lithium ion per unit charge (i.e. 100.% of lithium atoms go through the oxidation reduction reaction) and the molar mass of lithium is 6.94 g/mol. Also recall that one unit charge is  1.6x10​-19​ coulombs, and a coulomb is one Ampere-second. [4 points]

```python
unit_charge =1.6e-19
#find the num of li ions by multiplying amp-hours by num of cells and multiplying by num seconds in an hour, divide by coulomb in unit-charge.

num_unit_charge = (( cell['ah'] * powerwall_cell ) * (3600 / 1) ) / unit_charge
mol_ions = 1 / 6.02214e23
li_g_mol = 6.94
#find the mass: ions * moles/ion * li grams / mol
tot_li_g = num_unit_charge * mol_ions * li_g_mol

print('total li ions: ' + format(num_unit_charge, '.2g'),
    '\ntotal li mass: ' + format(tot_li_g, '.2g'), 'g')
```

**ANSWERS:**

- total li ions: 3.9e+25
- total li mass: 4.5e+02 g

### 2c

Total lithium deposits in the world are estimated at 20 x 10​9​ kg. One critique about Li-ion battery  technology is the amount of the lithium resource (it is estimated that all the lithium in the world could only electrify 62% of the world’s vehicle fleet). If 500 million homes were to install a first-generation Powerwall, what percentage of the world’s lithium resources would be used up? [2 points]

```python
homes = 500e6
world_li = 20e9
percent_li = ((tot_li_g / 1e3 ) * homes) / world_li

print('percent of li used: ' + format(percent_li, '.1g'))
```

**ANSWERS:**

percent of li used: ~1%

### 2d GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY [part d] (PP284/ER200)

Review the following discharge curves for a lithium coin battery (the type commonly found in  watches). The battery has a rated capacity of 240 mAh and a voltage cutoff of 1.6 V (below which the  voltage is too low to power the electronics in the device). Estimate the difference in energy delivered  when the rate of discharge is 3.0 mA vs. 0.5mA. (Your estimates can be very rough, so long as they  are grounded in the basic characteristics of the discharge curves --1 s.f.). What explains the difference? [4 points]

```python

#it is the area under the respective curves that represents the total energy delievered at different currents.
#we need to find the difference in those areas. To estimate, we find the E per grid square
square_w = 0.2 * 20
#then we make a rough estimation of the number of squares in the difference area and find the product.
num_squares = 32
total_w = square_w * num_squares

```

**ANSWERS:** ~ 100 watts

## 3 Biomass Energy & Transportation [18 points]

Biomass can be used to create ethanol fuel. It can also be used to generate electricity, that can then be used to charge electric vehicles (EVs). In this problem, you will determine whether ethanol or electricity can provide a higher biomass-to-wheel efficiency. Assume that one hectare of cropland can produce 14 tons of dry  switchgrass per year and that dry switchgrass has an energy density of 15 MJ/kg.

### 3a

Each ton of dry switchgrass can be processed to produce 73 gallons of ethanol. Ethanol has an energy density of 92 MJ/gallon. Assume that the internal combustion engine (ICE) is 23% efficient in converting fuel energy to useful work at the wheels (motion). With what efficiency is biomass energy delivered to the wheels in this ICE car? (4 points)

```python
grass = {
    'tonnes_hectare': 14,
    'e_mj_kg': 15,
    'gal_tonne': 73
}

eth_e_mj_gal = 92
ice_eff = 0.23

#find potential energy of switchgrass per gallon
grass['pot_e_mj_gal'] = (grass['e_mj_kg'] * 1000) / grass['gal_tonne']
#find total efficiency by comparing ethanol density + ICE eff to potential energy per gal
biofuel_eff = (eth_e_mj_gal * ice_eff) / grass['pot_e_mj_gal']

print('switchgrass to biofuel to car eff: ' + format(biofuel_eff,'.2g'))

```

**ANSWERS:** switchgrass to biofuel to car eff: ~10%

### 3b

Alternatively, each ton of dry switchgrass could be used directly to generate electricity, and this  electricity could in turn be used to operate an EV. Assume that a biomass-fueled power plant has a first-law efficiency of 37%. There is a 8.0% loss for transmission and distribution of electricity from the power plant to the car charging station. The motor plus battery is 85% efficient in converting electrical energy delivered from the charging station to mechanical work. With what efficiency is biomass energy delivered to the wheels in this ICE car? (4 points)

```python

pp_eff = 0.37
trans_loss = 0.08
e_car = 0.85

grass['to_ev_kj_tonne'] = grass['e_mj_kg'] * (pp_eff - trans_loss) * 0.85
grass_ev_eff = grass['to_ev_kj_tonne'] / grass['e_mj_kg']

print('switchgrass to EV eff: ' + format(grass_ev_eff,'.2g'))
```

**ANSWERS:** switchgrass to EV eff: 0.25

### 3c

According to the above analysis regarding these two uses of biomass for transportation, if we are concerned about utilizing biomass resources most energy efficiently, should we use biomass to generate electricity or should we use it to produce liquid fuels? Many factors are left out in this analysis. Using what you’re learned throughout this class, mention and briefly explain two  shortcomings of this simplified analysis. (5 points)

**ANSWERS:**

!!!ELECTRIFY ALL THE THINGS!

### 3d

Let’s assume switchgrass is used to produce ethanol for use in 100% ethanol-fueled vehicles. How much land (in km​2​) would be required for switchgrass production to provide enough ethanol to meet the fuel demand of all cars the United States? (Assume 264 million cars traveling an average of 13,000 mi/yr with an average fuel economy of 24 miles/gallon ethanol.) Roughly which US state is this [land area comparable to?](​https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_area​) (5 points)

```python
cars = {
    'n': 264e6,
    'mi_yr': 13e3,
    'eth_mpg': 24
}

sq_km_hect = 100

#find total km by finding gallons needed per year per car -> tonnes required per car -> hectares per car * num cars, coverted to km^2

grass['total_sq_km'] = (cars['mi_yr'] / cars['eth_mpg']) / grass['gal_tonne'] / grass['tonnes_hectare'] * cars['n'] / 1e2

print( 'total km^2 required: ' + format(grass['total_sq_km'],'.2g'))
```

**ANSWERS:** total km^2 required: 1.4e+06, similar to land area of AK.

## 4 Climate Change & Earth’s Energy Budget [13 points undergrad, 19 points grad]

Read through this summary report from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2013 from this [week’s readings:](​https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf) In section C - “Drivers of Climate Change” there is a chart listing major drivers of changes in radiative  forcing (W/m2) of Earth’s energy budget.  Radiative forcing (RF) measures the difference between sunlight  absorbed by the earth and energy radiated back to space, quantifying the change in energy fluxes (in Watts per  m2 of Earth’s surface) caused by these atmospheric drivers relative to the year 1750 (pre-industrial period).  Positive RF leads to surface warming, negative RF leads to surface cooling.

### 4a

According to the above chart, which compounds from anthropogenic activities have resulted in positive  radiative forcing since 1750 (i.e. have had a greenhouse effect and contributed to surface warming)?  List at  least 3. [3 points]

**ANSWERS:**
1.
2.
3.
  
### 4b

What are the relationships between some of the atmospheric compounds you listed in part a and the  global production and use of energy for human needs (i.e. electricity, transportation, heating, food production  etc.)?  Discuss at least two compounds and links to these human activities. [3 points]

**ANSWERS:**
1.
2.
  
### 4c

What do negative values of radiative forcing imply?  Which class of compounds exhibit the strongest  negative radiative forcing (i.e. reverse greenhouse effect and contribution to surface cooling)? [3 points]

**ANSWERS:**

### 4d

Using what you learned in the readings and lecture on the topic of climate change, what are some major  challenges for achieving international consensus and commitment on global climate action?  List at least two  issues. [4 points]

**ANSWERS:**
1.
2.

### 4e GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY [parts e, f] (PP284/ER200)

Note the bottom portion of the chart displaying the increase in net anthropogenic radiative forcing in  W/m​2​ on the Earth’s surface relative to the year 1750.  Assuming a value of +2.3 W/m​2​ in the year 2018,  what will be the total additional energy flux on Earth’s entire surface for this year? Express your answers in  Joules (J) and to 2 significant figures. [4 points]

## 5 Climate Change and You [15 points]

Former ERG PhD student Chris Jones has created a tool for individuals to estimate all direct and  indirect emissions of GHGs in CO​2​-equivalent units resulting from their choices regarding transportation, food, housing (including energy use), and goods and services consumption. Go to [Chris’s website](​https://coolcalifornia.arb.ca.gov/calculator-households-individuals​) and use the  calculator to answer the following questions regarding your carbon footprint. You can choose to  provide values for just yourself or for your whole household, either one is acceptable. (Please be as honest and accurate as possible with the calculator inputs you provide. The information will be kept confidential.)

### 5a

What is the ratio of the highest category (e.g. travel, home, food, goods, or services) of your emissions to the lowest? What is the ratio of your total emissions to the national average of roughly 22 tons CO​2​ per person per year? What is the ratio of your total emissions to the global average of 6 tons CO​2​ per person per year? [6 points]

**ANSWERS:**

1. Travel, 12% better
2. Home, 37% better
3. Services, 56% better
4. Food, 6% better
5. Goods, 82% better

21 tons CO2 eq/year
49% Better than Average

### 5b

What do you find most surprising about your results? Please explain in a few sentences. [3 points]

**ANSWERS:**

I was surprised that my travel ratio was still under the average. Since my partner is from China, I travel to Asia on a regular basis and still came in under both the national average overall of 22 tons CO2 and 12% better than the average in my city for travel. I suppose this comes down mostly to the fact that I don't have to travel by car on a daily basis much, traveling mostly by bicylce and public transit, with a very short commute compared to others, but it still seems low. I also found it interesting that I had such a good ratio for goods. Perhaps I did a poor estimation, or just buy that much less stuff than the average consumer.

### 5c

What lifestyle changes would you have to make in order to emit no more than the global per capita average of 6 tons of CO​2​? To do this, change the values you entered in the calculator until your total emissions are below 6 tons CO​2​. Try to make realistic choices. What do the results say about how your lifestyle compares to the lifestyles of the majority of people on the planet? Could you live at or below the global average? Please explain in one short paragraph. [6 points]

**ANSWERS:**

It would be extremely difficult to meet the 6 tons CO2 limit. Even if I cut out all air travel, cut my already limited car travel by half, cut out all meat, reduce goods spending by half, offset 100% of my electricity, and cut my natural gas by half, I still only can only get to 8 tons / year. I have to cut out most medical services and other services out completely in order to hit the 6 ton mark. Needless to say, even with a ratio of 49% better than average for my neighborhood and under the rough national average, I live a lifestyle far above the average person on earth. It is actually hard to fathom what living a fossil fuel dependent 6 tons CO2 lifestyle would be like. While cutting my air and car travel could make a signficant dent in my CO2 emissions, I don't see that as practical right now, and cutting out medical services (which I already spend near the bottom of what I could for basic coverage) would really reduce quality of life.
